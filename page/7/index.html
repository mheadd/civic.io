		<p>The thing I&#8217;ve always loved about hackathons is how they make it possible for anyone to build something that can help fix a problem facing a neighborhood, community or city.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3416" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2014/07/22/the-hacker-ethos-and-better-cities/icon_3168-2/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png" data-orig-size="250,250" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="icon_3168" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png?w=250" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png?w=250" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png?w=1000" alt="icon_3168"   class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3416" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png 250w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/icon_31681.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>Going to a hackathon isn&#8217;t like going to a government-sponsored meeting, or legislative hearing &#8211; those are places where people offer testimony to others, who may or may not take the advice given and implement some policy or legislative action. Hackathons are where people go to build actual solutions that help fix real problems.</p>
<p>The hacker ethos attracts people who don&#8217;t like layers of bureaucracy between the problems they see around them and the solutions that want to implement. We live in a time when it has never been easier for people without title, station or office to affect real change in the lives of people in their neighborhoods &#8211; to build solutions to fix problems they care about. This is an attractive draw for people that want to make a difference and its why the number of hackathons has grown in recent years, and continues to grow.</p>
<p>I see these same sentiments in an exciting project developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KristyT">Kristy Tillman</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/people/tiffani-bell/">Tiffani Bell</a>. They built the <a href="http://detroitwaterproject.org/">Detroit Water Project</a> to help Detroit residents in danger of having their water service cut off get paired up with people that can make a payment (or partial payment) on their behalf.</p>
<p>This is the kind of project I would expect to see at a hackathon &#8211; it has very few rough edges but looks like it was put together rapidly. It effectively leverages powerful, cheap online tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/google-d-s/createforms.html">Google forms</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rhodrimorgan/status/491567831939825664">social media</a> to engage with people that want to get involved. </p>
<p>And it is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity and effectiveness. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the elevator pitch &#8211; there are folks in the City of Detroit (a city facing significant <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/99999999/NEWS01/120322073&amp;template=theme&amp;theme=detroit_financial_crisis">challenges</a>) in danger of having their water service cut off because they are unable to pay their bill. This is an issue affecting thousands of people in real need and <a href="http://detroitwaterbrigade.org/">galvanizing a movement</a> to help prevent it. The Detroit Water Project enables people anywhere in the country to help with just a few mouse clicks and at the cost of a night out on the town. Boom.</p>
<p>This is how people with the hacker ethos want to invest their time, talents and energy. They are surfacing the question that more people need to step up and help answer &#8211; are we going to sit by and let cities like Detroit crumble, or are we going to get off our asses and pitch in?</p>
<p>This project wasn&#8217;t built at a hackathon, but it&#8217;s everything a hackathon project can be (and should be). Kristy and Tiffani are hackers &#8211; and I mean that as the highest compliment I can pay someone.</p>
<p>This is how our cities are going to get better.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
The Freedom of Information Act, passed in 1966 to increase trust in government by encouraging transparency, has always been a pain in the ass. You write to an uncaring bureaucracy, you wait for months or years only to be denied or redacted into oblivion, and even if you do get lucky and extract some useful information, the world has already moved on to other topics. But for more and more people in the past few years, FOIA is becoming worth the trouble. </p>
<p>&#8212;<a href="https://medium.com/matter/the-secret-to-getting-top-secret-secrets-1f693eaf609a"> The Secret to Getting Top Secret Secrets</a>, by Jason Fagone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that the <a href="http://www.nfoic.org/state-freedom-of-information-laws">FOIA</a> process was an important part of a healthy open data program. That may seem like an obvious thing to say, but there are  lot of people involved in the open data movement who either have limited exposure to FOIA or just enough exposure to truly to loath it.</p>
<p>In addition, the people inside government who are responsible for responding to FOIA requests may have very different feelings about releasing data than those that are part of an open data program.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/alignment.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="alignment" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>There are lots of reasons why, for advocates of open data, the FOIA process is suboptimal. A number of them are discussed in <a href="http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/">a recent blog post by Chris Whong</a>, an open data advocate in New York City and a co-captain of the NYC Code for America Brigade, who FOIA&#8217;d the NYC Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission for bulk <a href="http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/">taxi trip data</a>.</p>
<p>Chris&#8217; post details many of things that open data advocates dislike about the FOIA process. It&#8217;s an interesting read, especially if you don&#8217;t know how the FOIA process works. </p>
<p>However, another more serious shortcoming of the FOIA process <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7910812">became obvious</a> almost immediately after the taxi trip data was posted for wider use. It turns out that the Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission had not done a sufficient job depersonalizing the data, and the encryption method used to obscure the license number of taxi drivers and their medallion number was  <a href="https://medium.com/@vijayp/of-taxis-and-rainbows-f6bc289679a1">easy to circumvent</a> with moderate effort.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that the Taxi Commission tried to obscure this personal data in the files it released and to also make sure the data was as usable as possible by the person who requested it. Striking this balance can be tricky, and it&#8217;s actually <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/02/04/city-budget-mandel-employee-salary/">not uncommon</a> for data released through FOIA requests to have information that may be viewed as sensitive in hindsight. </p>
<p>I think one of the reasons this happens with data released through FOIA is that the process is not usually coupled tightly enough with the open data review process. I think we can make FOIA better (and, by extension, make the open data process better) by running more FOIA requests through the vetting and review process used to release open data.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome vs. Process</strong></p>
<p>In my experience, there is often very little connection between the process for responding to FOIA requests and the open data release process. Beyond reviewing FOIA requests in the aggregate to see if there are opportunities for bulk data releases, the FOIA process and the open data release process often happen independently of one another. This is certainly the case in the City of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In Philly, open data releases are coordinated by the Chief Data Officer in the Office of Innovation and Technology. FOIA requests &#8211; or <a href="http://openrecords.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/open_records/4434/right-to-know_law/466460">Right to Know Requests</a> as they are known in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania &#8211; are handled by staff in the Law Department, or personnel that have been identified as Right to Know Officers for their specific department. </p>
<p>These requests almost always get treated as one-off tasks, never to be repeated again. Even though requests for the same data may be made at a later date, I&#8217;ve never seen the people working on FOIA requests in Philly take the approach of making their work to respond to these requests repeatable.</p>
<p>The problem with a bifurcated approach to data releases like this is that it forces people to think of the work to respond to FOIA requests as disposable. Something that happens once &#8211; an outcome, instead of a process. Open data done correctly is about establishing a process &#8211; one that includes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit#heading=h.2xameguvnm7b">opportunities for review</a> and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Toward Better FOIA Releases</strong></p>
<p>Because FOIA is viewed as a one and done task, there is no opportunity to iteratively release data &#8211; if the release of NYC taxi trip data had been viewed as a process (particularly a collaborative one), the Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission could have opted to be conservative in their initial release and then enhanced future releases based on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/opendataphilly/0R8h6eXYkCg">actual feedback from real consumers</a> of the data. </p>
<p>In Philadelphia, we employed a group called the <a href="https://gist.github.com/PhillyCDO/4261371">Open Data Working Group</a> to help review and vet proposed data releases. This is an interdisciplinary group from across different city departments which helped provide feedback and input on a number of important data releases that required depersonalization or redaction of of sensitive data &#8211; <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/215/philadelphia-police-part-one-crime-incidents/">crime incidents</a>, complaints filed against <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/218/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaints/">active duty police officers</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, part of our release process involved reaching out to select outside data consumers to get feedback and help identify issues prior to broader release. Because we <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia">used GitHub for many of our data releases</a>, we could set up private repos for our planned data releases and ask selected experts to help us vet and review by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-organization-members-to-a-team">adding them as collaborators</a> prior to making these data repos public.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to Alignment</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
I think for a lot of amateurs, their alignment is always out.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/Karrie_Webb">Karrie Webb</a>, professional golfer
</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to data releases, there is <a href="https://twitter.com/spjika/status/472446894908506112">no substitute for experience</a> &#8211; that&#8217;s why integrating FOIA releases into an existing open data release process can be so beneficial. Leveraging the process for reviewing open data releases can improve the quality of FOIA releases and bring these two critical elements of the open data process into closer alignment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hopeful that cities, particularly Philadelphia, will begin to see the merit of better aligning FOIA responses and open data releases.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>The great truism that underlies the civic technology movement of the last several years is that governments face difficulty implementing technology, and they generally manage IT assets and projects very poorly.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of a larger disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly &#8211; technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p>But the challenges facing governments as it relates to technology are quite specific &#8211; there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these factors are and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically.</p>
<p>The challenges that governments face in adopting new technology are not symptomatic of a larger disfunction &#8211; when it comes to the efficient adoption of technology, governments are built to fail.</p>
<p><strong>The Government Procurement Process</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, primarily as a result of the botched rollout of the federal <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">Healthcare.gov</a> website, there has been significant attention given to the aspects of the government procurement process that hinder efficient technology adoption.</p>
<p>The process clearly does not work well for governments – and many would argue that it does not work well for technology vendors either. Typical government procurement rules shut out many small firms that may be well positioned to execute on a government IT project but that lack the organizational endurance to make it through the lengthy selection process.</p>
<p>The process is complex, costly and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; slow. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia the period between a contract award (when a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of that contract (when the work actually begins) can take an average of four months for some projects. Some technology solutions have shorter release cycles than that.</p>
<p>This makes the government procurement process particularly ill suited (in its current form) as a means for governments to acquire technology. The pace at which new technologies mature is much more rapid, and the glacial pace at which the government procurement process moves can lock governments into outdated solutions.</p>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the procurement process is that it’s current design is largely intentional. Governments imbue the process with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.</p>
<p>For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.</p>
<p>There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.</p>
<p>Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.</p>
<p>These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.</p>
<p>In other words, <a href="../../2013/12/27/three-hard-truths-for-government-procurement-reform/index.html">the procurement process works largely as it was built to work</a>, but its design makes it a lousy tool for acquiring technology.</p>
<p><strong>The Public Budgeting Process</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps more fundamental than the procurement process, the process used by governments to deliberate and adopt spending plans <a href="../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">is deeply flawed</a> as it relates to encouraging innovation generally and adopting new technologies specifically. There are built-in disincentives in the public budgeting process for agencies to demonstrate large efficiency gains that result in the need to outlay fewer dollars.</p>
<p>Public agencies that have unused allocations at the end of a fiscal year – money that is appropriated but not spent – inevitably see those dollars redirected to another agency or policy priority in the next budget cycle. Mayors, governors, and legislators see this as an effective way to allocate finite resources between competing interests. If an agency doesn’t spend down their entire budget allocation, they must not need it and a reduction is justified. In other words, the budget process works as government administrators have designed it to work &#8211; to reallocate resources away from agencies that don&#8217;t need them to agencies that do.</p>
<p>However, most agencies see this outcome as unfavorable &#8211; a diminution of their mission and a loss for the clientele that they serve and are advocates for. It can be a powerful disincentive for agencies to use new technologies to create efficiencies that result in cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Recruitment &amp; Retention</strong></p>
<p>Most government employees &#8211; at the federal, state and local levels &#8211; are hired into an agency through a merit-based <a href="http://www.phila.gov/personnel/About.html">civil service system</a>. The development of civil service systems, which are supposed to grant job opportunities on the basis of merit, were a response to widespread political patronage that was common long ago. </p>
<p>Most civil service systems have fairly rigid job classifications and salary structures, meant to provide transparency into what specific positions are paid and to place limits on the ability to reward specific employees because of political preference or for other reasons. There are typically requirements for public job postings, and advertisement of openings for specified period. Applicants are typically required to demonstrate fitness for a position and may often be required to take a civil service exam to demonstrate minimum competency on a particular subject.</p>
<p>Not unlike the procurement system, we imbue certain values into the civil service system in the hopes of fostering outcomes deemed favorable. For example, in the City of Philadelphia the <a href="http://phillycode.org/20-1101/">children of police and fire personnel are given preference</a> in the civil service process. This is not meant to suggest that granting such applicants a preference is inherently a bad thing, but (as with the procurement process) using the civil service system as a vehicle for fostering outcomes can come at the cost of making the process more lengthy and complex for all applicants.</p>
<p>Public sector salaries and benefits generally lag behind the private sector, and altering pay structures and adding new job classifications in response to changes in the world of technology can be difficult. This is particularly troubling for those interested in recruiting top IT talent into government because, unlike with many other kinds of government job types, governments are in direct competition with the private sector for IT workers. A &#8220;system administrator&#8221; or a &#8220;web developer&#8221; or a &#8220;project manager&#8221; requires largely the same kinds of skills and experience inside of government or outside.</p>
<p>Like the procurement process and the budget process, the civil service system works as it was designed to work. Unfortunately, the way that it works makes it ill suited for attracting and retaining a highly skilled IT workforce.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Building to Fail</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly interesting is that even if the policies that underpin each of these processes doesn&#8217;t change at all in the next several years, the problems that governments face in adopting new technology will get steadily worse. That&#8217;s because the pace of change in the world of technology continues to accelerate &#8211; as it does, the difference between the rate at which new technologies mature and the rate at which governments can make budget or purchasing decisions, or reclassify jobs and salaries in response will get larger.</p>
<p>The old Hippocratic maxim of &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; will be insufficient in addressing this problem. We absolutely must do better, and we must do it soon.</p>
<p><strong>How Do we Fix It?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for advocates of successful technology adoption in government to understand why governments face so many challenges in acquiring and implementing technology. The processes that support paying for and acquiring technology, and the process for hiring IT workers are designed in a way that make them a bad match for the dynamics of the technology industry. </p>
<p>Knowing why governments face challenges in implementing new technology is important if we&#8217;re going to find ways to address the problem. When we examine the range of different approaches being advocated to help governments more successfully adopt technology, we should evaluate their merits based on the degree to which they address one or more of the processes detailed above.</p>
<p>There are lots of other examples of efforts underway to help governments get better at implementing and using technology &#8211; too many to discuss fully here. But the ultimate success of each will be tied &#8211; I believe &#8211; to the degree to which they help address the challenges engineered into one of the three processes discussed above &#8211; procurement, budgeting and employee recruitment / retention.</p>
<p>Governments are not bad at adopting new technologies on accident. The processes that support the adoption of new technology were built to fail. Understanding this is the first step to fixing them.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>The civic technology community has a love-hate relationship with transit apps.</p>
<p>We love to, and often do, use the example of open transit data and the cottage industry of civic app development it has helped spawn as justification for governments releasing open data. Some of the earliest, most enduring and most successful civic applications have been built on transit data and there literally <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/apps/">hundreds of different apps</a> available.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)</a>, which has helped to encourage the release of transit data from dozens and dozens of transportation authorities across the country, is used as the model for the development of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/cities/data-standards-faq/">other open data standards</a>. I once described work being done to develop a data standard for locations dispensing vaccinations as &#8220;GTFS for flu shots.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbt/status/474914802947878912"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/bracken-tweet.png?w=300&#038;h=275" alt="bracken-tweet" width="300" height="275" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></a></p>
<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbt/status/474914802947878912">some in the civic technology community chafe</a> at the overuse of transit apps as the example cited for the release of open data and engagement with outside civic hackers. Surely there are other examples we can point to that get at deeper, more fundamental problems with civic engagement and the operation of government. Is the best articulation of the benefits of open data and civic hacking a simple bus stop application?</p>
<p>Last week at Transparency Camp in DC, during a <a href="http://transparencycamp.org/schedule/2014/open-data-from-the-inside/">session I ran on open data</a>, I was asked what data governments should focus on releasing as open data. I stated my belief that &#8211; at a minimum &#8211; governments should concentrate on <strong>The 3 B&#8217;s</strong>: Buses (transit data), Bullets (crime data) and Bucks (budget &amp; expenditure data). </p>
<p>To be clear &#8211; transit data and the apps it helps generate are critical to the open data and civic technology movements. I think it is vital to exploring the role that transit apps have played in the development of the civic technology ecosystem and their impact on open data.</p>
<h4>Story telling with transit data</h4>
<p>Transit data supports more than just &#8220;next bus&#8221; apps. In fact, characterizing all transit apps this way does a disservice to the talented and creative people working to build things with transit data. Transit data supports a wide range of different visualizations that can tell an intimate, granular story about how a transit system works and how it&#8217;s operation impacts a city.</p>
<p><a href="http://mbtaviz.github.io/">One inspiring example</a> of this kind of app was developed recently by Mike Barry and Brian Card, and looked at the operation of MBTA in Boston. Their motive was simple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We attempt to present this information to help people in Boston better understand the trains, how people use the trains, and how the people and trains interact with each other.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re able to tell nuanced stories about transit systems because the quality of data being released continues to expand and improve in quality. This happens because developers building apps in cities across the country have provided feedback to transit officials on what they want to see and the quality of what is provided.  </p>
<p>Developers building the powerful visualizations we see today are <a href="http://policybythenumbers.blogspot.com/2012/01/transit-transparency-open-data-in.html">standing on the shoulders of the people that built the &#8220;next bus&#8221; apps a few years ago</a>. Without these humble apps, we don&#8217;t get to tell these powerful stories today.</p>
<h4>Holding government accountable</h4>
<p>Transit apps are about more than just getting to the train on time. </p>
<p>Support for transit system operations can run into the billions of dollars and affect the lives of millions of people in an urban area. With this much investment, it&#8217;s important that transit riders and taxpayers are able to hold officials accountable for the efficient operation of transit systems. To help us do this, we now have a <a href="http://phor.net/apps/septa/">new generation of transit apps</a> that can examine things like the scheduled arrival and departure times of trains with their actual arrival and departure time.</p>
<p>Not only does this give citizens transparency into how well their transit system is being run, it offers a pathway for engagement &#8211; by knowing which routes are not performing close to scheduled times, transit riders and others can offer suggestions for changes and improvements.</p>
<h4>A gateway to more open data</h4>
<p>One of the most important things that transit apps can do is provide a pathway for more open data.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, the city&#8217;s formal open data policy and the creation of an <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">open data portal</a> all followed after the efforts of a small group of developers working to obtain transit schedule data from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). This group eventually built the region&#8217;s <a href="http://isepta.org/">first transit app</a>.</p>
<p>This small group pushed SEPTA to make their data open, and the Authority eventually <a href="http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/">embraced open data</a>. This, in turn, raised the profile of open data with other city leaders and directly contributed to the adoption of an <a href="http://www.phila.gov/data/Pages/data.aspx">open data policy by the City of Philadelphia</a> several years later. Without this simple transit app and the push for more open transit data, I don&#8217;t think this would have happened. Certainly not as soon as it did.</p>
<p>And it isn&#8217;t just big cities like Philadelphia. In Syracuse, NY &#8211; a small city with no tradition of civic hacking and no formal open data program &#8211; a group at a <a href="http://hackupstate.com/">local hackathon</a> decided that they wanted to build <a href="http://data-syracuse.herokuapp.com/">a platform for government open data</a>. </p>
<p>The first data source they selected to focus on? Transit data. The first app they built? A transit app.</p>
<p>In the next year or so, as the open data movement in Syracuse picks up steam, people will be able to look back at this development as the catalyst for it all. Transit apps and transit data are a gateway to adoption of a more comprehensive open data policy by governments. </p>
<p>In many ways, those of us working in the civic technology and open data fields are standing on the shoulders of the people who built all those &#8220;next bus&#8221; apps a few years back. Their efforts, and the value of transit apps, deserve our recognition.</p>

		<p>Interesting things are happening at Philly Hackathons.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/its-alive.jpg?w=300&#038;h=204" alt="its-alive" width="300" height="204" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Increasingly, participants at local events are opting to work on what would best be described as &#8220;citizen science&#8221; projects &#8211; projects not focused on the development of an app as a final product, but where an app or device constructed at the event is the means to a loftier end. </p>
<p>The goal of these projects &#8211; a better understanding of how our city works and ways that we can improve it. Some great examples of these citizen science projects being worked on by Philly hackers are:</p>
<p><a href="http://greenstemnetwork.org/">Project GreenSTEM</a> &#8211; Originally developed as part of last year&#8217;s AT&amp;T EduTech Hackathon, this project is focused on the development of an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>-powered urban sensor network. It&#8217;s currently being <a href="http://citypaper.net/article.php?How-the-Water-Dept.-and-civic-hackers-are-helping-student-gardens-go-high-tech-20130">integrated into the curriculum</a> at four of Philadelphia&#8217;s public schools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyclephilly.org/">CyclePhilly</a> &#8211; Though this project is centered on an app, the ambitions of its sponsors are as big as the Delaware Valley. The goal of the project is to get as many bikers as possible to use the app to generate data on how they travel, which will inform planning decisions made by the City of Philadelphia and the <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/">Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://climatetracker.wordpress.com/">Climate Tracker</a> &#8211; Another mobile sensor network project, this one is focused on bus-mounted devices that will collect climate and air quality information from around Philadelphia. The data generated will be used <a href="http://www.phillytreemap.org/">in conjunction with other data sets</a> to inform both citizens and researchers.</p>
<p>These citizen science projects still make up a minority of the things worked on at hackathons and <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">local hack nights</a>, but understanding why participants are opting to work on them can give us insights into how we might alter the structure of hackathons &#8211; to make them more effective and to help ensure the work being done at these events is sustained over the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>Opting for Science</strong></p>
<p>One of the unifying characteristics of the project listed above is that each is focused on the generation of data &#8211; data that can be used by others to make better decisions. The apps and sensors developed as part of these projects are incidental to a larger, more important goal. Generating data that can be used as part of scientific or administrative processes.</p>
<p>This is a fairly dramatic departure from the usual app-centric focus of hackathons.</p>
<p>The reasons that we are seeing more citizen science projects turn up at hackathons is the result of a couple of different factors. First, the availability of cheap, powerful microcomputers and sensors technology. Products like <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">BeagleBone</a>, <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/collections/ninja-blocks">Ninja Blocks</a> others are making it incredibly cheap to obtain, work with and create powerful new devices.</p>
<p>It&#8217; also <a href="http://cylonjs.com/">becoming easier</a> for <a href="http://rad.rubyforge.org/">mainstream programmers</a> to start to work with hardware, robotics and other kinds of physical device technologies. These developments are putting pressure on the traditional structure of hackathons, which are set up to produce apps. </p>
<p>Most hackathons are set up to run over a specific period of time &#8211; much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)">a sprint</a> in agile software development. And many of the conventions used in hackathons (like demoing a workable prototype at the end) conform to the practices of software development methodologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#End_meetings">Scrum</a>. (This isn&#8217;t surprising since hackathons originally came out of the world of software development.)</p>
<p>In short, hackathons are almost always structured in a traditional way &#8211; one designed to deliver apps, not citizen science projects. So the fact that we are starting to see these projects developed at hackathons despite the structural bias toward apps is noteworthy. </p>
<p><strong>Making Hackathons Better</strong></p>
<p>So what do all these citizen science projects tell us about how we should structure hackathons going forward &#8211; in short, we need to make room for science.</p>
<p>We need to rethink the typical weekend hackathon and the focus on building narrowly focused apps. We need to find structures that support the development of different ideas with longer term goals, that may not have a finished app that can be loaded in a web browser or pulled up on a mobile device at the end of a weekend. We need to encourage projects that are focused on collecting data, from all over our city, that can help us better understand how it works &#8211; data that can be used by others to conduct research, or build apps of their own.</p>
<p>This is starting to happen in Philly, and in other places as well. One notable example here is the upcoming <a href="http://www.phillyecocamp.org/">EcoCamp event</a> being sponsored by Azavea. It features a hackathon that is paired with an unconference and workshops &#8211; a pretty cool idea that I hope leads to some interesting citizen science projects. Code for Philly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-America-Philly/">weekly hack nights</a> have also been instrumental in helping these science projects move along the path to viability as well &#8211; another reason to love (and support) your local <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the standard weekend hackathon for building apps is going away. Just that we need to think clearly about the kind of events we want, and what we hope to get out of them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to more hackathons in Philly, and more citizen science projects.</p>

		<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Are people innately altruistic?&#8217; is the wrong kind of question to ask. People are people, and they respond to incentives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Steven Levitt &amp; Stephen Dubner (SuperFreakonomics)
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the most important things an open data directive can accomplish &#8211; whether it takes the form an informal policy, an executive order or an open data statute &#8211; is to help create a set of incentives that can foster a &#8216;data culture&#8217; inside government.</p>
<p>Open data has the potential to <a href="../../2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/index.html">transform how governments operate</a> by changing the way government officials look at and use data. But the bureaucracy has a number of built in disincentives that can work against this outcome if they are not addressed through a well designed open data policy.</p>
<p>Open data is about more than just releasing data to external consumers &#8211; though this is a critical outcome that is required if governments hope to achieve additional benefits. It&#8217;s about training government officials to think about the power inherent in data. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s about creating a data culture in government.</p>
<p><strong>Institutional barriers to open data</strong></p>
<p>When most people think about barriers to open data, they think about the technological and political barriers to governments opening up more data for outside use. Many of the systems that house government data are decades old, and extracting information to release as open data can be time consuming and difficult. In addition, there is <a href="http://axisphilly.org/article/the-tension-at-the-heart-of-open-data-in-philly/">still resistance</a> in some corners of governments to releasing information that could be used by outside parties to <a href="http://planphilly.com/series/philadelphias-tax-delinquency-conundrum">evaluate the performance of government agencies</a>.</p>
<p>But beyond these more obvious barriers there are other, less obvious impediments that may work against governments both releasing data to outside users and also to making more effective use of data themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Open Data Benefits Mismatch</strong></p>
<p>One of the more common impediments to open data is when a mismatch exists between the potential benefits of opening data to outside users and the responsibility of maintaining it.</p>
<p>In many of the cities that I have talked with, data on the locations of fire hydrants is often thought of as sensitive data. While it is true that hydrants represent an important part of municipal water systems, they are visible to those around their locations and this data is released to the public in some municipalities to support civic applications like <a href="http://adoptahydrant.org/">Adopt-a-Hydrant</a>.</p>
<p>In some cities, the responsibility for managing data on fire hydrants rests with the Water Department &#8211; it is this department that is charged with managing water infrastructure and usually has responsibility for disseminating information to those that need it &#8211; other government officials, contractors, regulators &#8211; on the location of water infrastructure assets. But the primary beneficiaries of the release of hydrant location data are entities like the Fire Department, Public Safety and Emergency Management.</p>
<p>An open data &#8220;benefits mismatch&#8221; exists around fire hydrant data because the benefits of releasing the data don&#8217;t accrue to the department that is responsible for maintaining it (and that will likely be held accountable if the data is inaccurate). This can create a strong disincentive to releasing such data, and should be taken into account when crafting an open data policy.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Scope &gt; Agency Mission</strong></p>
<p>Another impediment to governments releasing data &#8211; and to using it more effectively themselves &#8211; can occur when the scope of an issue that governments are charged with addressing is larger than the mission of any one department.</p>
<p>Take for example the issue of vacant property &#8211; which is an issue that faces almost every municipal government in the U.S. This is a huge, sprawling, multi-faceted issue that often goes beyond the focused mission of any one agency that is involved with it. The problem of vacant and derelict property touches on crime, poverty, revenue collections, zoning, environmental protection and many others. In cities like Philadelphia there may be half a dozen or more separate departments charged with addressing one or more aspects of this complex issue.</p>
<p>Consider the number of different city departments that may have information on the scope of the vacancy problem. The <a href="http://phila.gov/li">Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections</a> views the world of vacant property through the lens of enforcement and counts those properties that it has issued violations against. The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/water">Water Department</a> views the world of vacants through water service, and counts those parcels that have an active account (and those that don&#8217;t). The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue">Revenue Department</a> views the world of vacants through collections, keeping track of those that are current on their property taxes and those that are not (some in arrears many years).</p>
<p>So how many vacant properties are there in a city like Philadelphia? There isn&#8217;t a 100% definitive answer because there isn&#8217;t a department that is charged with keeping track of vacant properties. Each of these departments has some data on the problem of vacancy, but their picture of the problem is viewed through the lens of the service they provide. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, there is no overarching authority that is formally charged with bringing these disparate data sets together and constructing a model for identifying the true picture of vacancy. Each is stuck in a pattern of looking only at their own data. There are no incentives for these agencies to combine data or cross check it against the data of other departments that might have insight into the problem of vacancy.</p>
<p>This is also data that could be enormously beneficial to the public &#8211; as vacant properties <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2013/03/09/part-one-lax-property-tax-enforcement-and-brazen-deadbeat-investors-have-depressed-philadelphia-s-property-tax-base-by-9-5-billion">negatively impact housing values</a> &#8211; and other departments, like the Police Department &#8211; because vacant properties are thought to be <a href="http://scordivano.cartodb.com/viz/b5abab5e-ff79-11e2-b7d2-9ffb398ef245/embed_map?title=true&amp;description=true&amp;search=true&amp;shareable=true&amp;cartodb_logo=true&amp;layer_selector=true&amp;scrollwheel=true&amp;sublayer_options=1|1&amp;sql=&amp;sw_lat=39.87904934281499&amp;sw_lon=-75.36003112792969&amp;ne_lat=40.07636385903448&amp;ne_lon=-74.92057800292969">related to the crime</a>.</p>
<p>This is a huge missed opportunity because of the potential analytics goldmine that could be generated if there was some focused effort to combine information on the problem of vacancy and keep track it. Since there isn&#8217;t a clear picture of the problem of vacancy, how do we know if we&#8217;re making progress in addressing it?</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Data Culture</strong></p>
<p>The problems discussed in this post are not unique to any one city, county or state &#8211; the fact is that most governments are not set up structurally in a way that encourages the efficient sharing of data &#8211; with the public, or with other government agencies.</p>
<p>This is what makes an open data policy so important. </p>
<p>Good open data policies can offset the structural impediments to open data and create a healthy set of incentives that fosters data sharing both inside and outside government.</p>

		<p>My time as the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s Chief Data Officer is <a href="../../2014/03/20/the-philadelphia-experiment/index.html">coming to an end</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an incredible experience &#8211; I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with a great team, and to have helped change the way that government officials think about open data and civic hacking. Before I move on to new things, however, I have a few more items I want to move into the &#8220;Done&#8221; column.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got one more week and three more things I want to get done.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Data.gov</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we&#8217;ve had on our radar for a while is getting the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s open data sets from <a href="http://OpenDataPhilly.org">OpenDataPhilly.org</a> listed in the <a href="https://www.data.gov/cities/community/cities/datasets">Cities community in the federal Data.gov site</a>. Currently, OpenDataPhilly.org is running an outdated version of the Open Data Catalog software &#8211; which has Data.gov integration built in &#8211; but a <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/data.gov">simple Node.js</a> script and the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/api-doc/">OpenDataPhilly API</a> make it pretty simple to generate the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">required metadata</a> file for listing our data sets there.</p>
<p>The metadata for our data now validates, and I&#8217;m hopeful that listings from OpenDataPhilly.org will appear in Data.gov this week &#8211; making it the first time listings from a community-managed site are listed in the national site for open data.</p>
<p><strong>Data on Professional Services Contracts</strong></p>
<p>For the past several months, we&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/INTEGRITYWORKS/who.html">Chief Integrity Officer</a> to open up data on <a href="https://trello.com/c/4qy1Aojj/54-city-contracts">professional services contracts</a> from city departments. Currently, information on professional services contracts is <a href="https://secure.phila.gov/econtract/">difficult to find</a>, and is provided only in PDF format.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of work has gone into generating comprehensive documentation for professional services contract data, as well as providing the data in a more usable format (as well as providing historical data going back several quarters). This work is close to being finished and I&#8217;m hopeful it will be launched in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Data on Lobbyist Registrations</strong></p>
<p>In addition, we&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/ethicsboard/Pages/default.aspx">Board of Ethics</a> as they implement a new lobbyist management system &#8211; this new system will allow individuals that act as lobbyist to register with the city and also submit their activity reports.</p>
<p>As part of this process, the Board of Ethics was gracious enough to allow us to consult on how open data could be integrated into their new system. They&#8217;ve been great to work with, and they recently rolled the first phase of this new system, which allows lobbyists to register &#8211; it also includes functionality which allows all registration information to be <a href="https://trello.com/c/XstFNMkl/91-lobbyist-registration">downloaded in CSV format</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working now to push out some comprehensive documentation for the lobbyist registration information CSV data &#8211; we hope to get this out before the end of the week.</p>
<p>Time is short, but there&#8217;s still lots to do.</p>

		<p>Three years ago next month, the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s open data portal was <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/04/25/data-crunched-all-that%E2%80%99s-needed-to-jump-start-an-open-data-movement-is-a-city-government-that-doesn%E2%80%99t-stand-in-the-way/">launched by local technology firm Azavea</a> as part of the inaugural Philly Tech Week. Two years ago next month, Philadelphia joined the small (but growing) fraternity of cities to adopt a formal open data policy &#8211; a milestone that stands as one of the first in something I think of as an &#8220;experiment&#8221; in municipal transparency. </p>
<p>Since this experiment first began, our open data efforts have come a very long way, and Philadelphia is now looked at as a national leader on open data and civic technology. In many ways it is now time for a new chapter in the Philadelphia experiment &#8211; our city is ready to take open data to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, though, it is time to step back and take a different role in the Philadelphia technology community and the broader open data effort &#8211; both here and in other places.</p>
<p><strong>How Far We&#8217;ve Come</strong></p>
<p>In the last several years, Philadelphia has grown into a national leader on open data and civic technology. We enthusiastically <a href="http://ph.ly/OpenDataGuide">share our experience and our ideas</a> with other municipalities that want to kick off their own open data experiment.</p>
<p>Our open data portal contains <a href="https://trello.com/b/iUUy84lK/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline">dozens of new data sets</a> added since the adoption of our open data policy, some released for the very first time by city government. The <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">OpenDataPhilly</a> platform has inspired <a href="http://www.opendatacincy.org/">efforts in other cities</a> that look to us as a model for how to implement their open data efforts.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObrlsMA7c3M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>We have embraced not only open data, but also open source software and we are actively <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia">sharing both our code and our data on platforms like GitHub</a> as a way to engage with the broader data community and tap into communities of innovators. The City of Philadelphia now has <a href="http://government.github.com/stories/philadelphia-gets-going-and-gets-open/">more public GitHub repos</a> than any other city in the country, and more are on the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re leading the discussion on the development of new <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-headd/how-technology-can-fight-the-flu_b_4495730.html">municipal data standards</a> that will help speed the adoption of other open data releases, and enhance the value of civic technology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re finding innovative new ways to engage with local technology vendors by making <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/">opportunities for smaller technology projects more visible</a>. We&#8217;re <a href="../../2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/index.html">using GitHub</a> and other platforms to make responding to technology procurement opportunities easier, more engaging and more valuable.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="http://phlapi.com/">growing suite of developer-ready APIs</a> that can be used to quickly and easily create powerful new civic apps. And, most importantly, we&#8217;re collaborating with <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">one of the most active civic hacking communities in the country</a> and helping to enable the building of all sorts of <a href="http://www.phlcrimemapper.com/">new</a> <a href="http://lti.planphilly.com/">awesome</a> <a href="http://groundedinphilly.org/">apps</a>. </p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia is ready for the next chapter in its open data experiment. </p>
<p>The milestones that lay ahead will see the release of important new data sets that will enable more meaningful and more sustainable <a href="http://ph.ly/DiscussPhillyData">civic engagement in our city</a>. These new data releases and APIs will also help create the foundation for unprecedented collaboration between city departments and other governments. No force has more potential to enable <a href="../../2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/index.html">significant improvements in government efficiency and operations</a> than open data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be watching all of this unfold from a new vantage point &#8211; as a member (once again) of the Philly technology and civic hacking communities. In early April, I&#8217;ll step down from my post as Chief Data Officer and return to being a professional technologist. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking more in the weeks ahead about exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing, but I&#8217;ll still be working with governments and open data. I&#8217;ll also still be in Philly &#8211; my wife and I will continue to live and work here, and our kids will still go to school here.</p>
<p>It has truly been an honor and a privilege to serve this great city, and I owe a debt of gratitude to Managing Director Rich Negrin and CIO Adel Abeid for the opportunity. I look forward to continuing to do so going forward, but from outside city government.</p>
<p>Philly&#8217;s open data effort has always been bigger than any one person &#8211; it&#8217;s always been about the community. It&#8217;s now time for me to rejoin that community.</p>
<p>See you at the next <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/events/hackathons/">hackathon</a>.</p>

						<a href="../../2014/03/07/apis-to-charge-or-not-to-charge/index.html"><span class="posted-on"><span class="screen-reader-text">Posted on </span><time class="entry-date published" datetime="March 7, 2014"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>March 7, 2014</time></span></a> <span class="byline">by <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../author/mheadd/index.html">mheadd</a></span></span>		</p>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>There&#8217;s a discussion starting on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/mQlwYRK5Y_0">U.S. Government API Google Group</a> on the subject of charging for the use of government APIs.</p>
<p>This is an interesting discussion (one that governments should pay attention to as they develop their API strategies) and is a nice follow up to my last post on <a href="../../2014/03/02/on-sustainable-civic-technology/index.html">sustainable civic technology</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly the decision about whether to charge users for accessing an API &#8211; whether to query an open data source, or to conduct some transaction with government &#8211; is one that each government needs to come to on their own after factoring in the potential benefits and consequences. But there are at least a few economic reasons that governments might want to consider whether charging for access to APIs makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any definitive answers here, but I think there are a few questions worthy of further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying who is using government APIs</strong></p>
<p>In economic parlance, public goods are characterized by two different factors &#8211; &#8220;rivalry&#8221; and &#8220;excluability.&#8221; Rivalry refers to the idea that some goods can be consumed simultaneously with other consumers without a diminished experience. Public goods are those that I can enjoy myself along with my neighbors and our simultaneous enjoyment of such a good doesn&#8217;t diminish the experience for any one of us, or anyone else.</p>
<p>Excludability refers to the idea that consumers of a good can be identified with relative ease, and that their consumption of a good may easily be conditioned on something. Such goods are often referred to as &#8220;toll goods&#8221; and the most often cited example of such a good is a toll road &#8211; a turnpike or highway.</p>
<p>Its fairly easy to restrict access to a toll road and condition the use of the resource on paying a tool (that&#8217;s what toll booths are for). This arrangement has the additional benefit of directing the cost for building and maintaining the resource on those that are actually using it. People that don&#8217;t drive aren&#8217;t subject to tolls, and there is a pretty strong argument that they shouldn&#8217;t be (because they&#8217;re not consuming the resource).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also fairly trivial to restrict access to a government API by requiring an API key or other credentials. Because API consumption shares much in common with the consumption of other toll goods, is there a justification for governments to charge for access? How strong is the argument that the cost to build and maintain the infrastructure behind APIs should be borne more directly by those that actually use them?</p>
<p><strong>APIs as a shared resource</strong></p>
<p>Another rationalization for charging for the consumption of certain goods and services is that price is an effective way of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing">rationing a scare resource</a>. APIs &#8211; particularly those that expose open data &#8211; are fundamentally different than something like a static data download. APIs are shared services with finite resources &#8211; my use of an API has the potential to impact other users of an API, depending on how I consume it.</p>
<p>Is it fair to allow one user, or a few users, of an API to potentially diminish the experience of other users by using it with enough frequency to impact performance? Even the most elegantly and expansively engineered APIs have limits &#8211; is price a way that governments can help ensure responsible use of an API?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that many SaaS and PaaS service providers offer a free tier for relative less intensive use of their platforms or APIs, and charge users at different levels based on the amount of usage for what is essentially a shared resource. Is this an approach that governments should emulate?</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability of IT infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, if and how a government employs a fee structure for access to APIs should be connected to plans for long-term sustainability of the IT infrastructure support the API. As I&#8217;ve said before, far too often governments <a href="../../2014/03/02/on-sustainable-civic-technology/index.html">do not budget properly for the long term care of IT assets</a>.</p>
<p>Could charging for access to government APIs generate a reliable revenue stream to help ensure resource for upkeep, maintenance and improvements to the systems behind these APIs?</p>
<p>At a minimum, governments should consider deploying a test environment for their APIs. If governments charge users for access to their APIs, they should allow new users and developers to experiment and build new apps without incurring costs, until they are ready to go to production. </p>
<p>I think a far more interesting question for governments is how many are deploying test environments that allow users to build new things without impacting production users. This is an area that I think many governments should spend some time exploring as they develop their API strategies.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>Sustaining civic technology will mean that both government&#8217;s IT infrastructure and the civic technology sector that builds on it will need to change.</p>
<p>A pair of recent blog posts caught my eye and highlighted this theme in my head, and motivated me to capture a few thoughts on this topic.</p>
<p>The first post was by Dan O&#8217;Neil, Executive Director of the Smart Chicago Collaborative. <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2014/02/some-thoughts-toward-the-maturation-of-the-civic-innovation-sector-of-the-technology-industry.html">Dan&#8217;s post</a> on the the things that need to happen to drive the &#8220;&#8230;maturation of the civic innovation sector of the technology industry&#8221; are worth the read. It&#8217;s a great post that helps highlight the connection between legacy IT system in government and open data, which is used to build civic technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;[without] existing legacy gov IT systems, there would be no civic tech. The data we use for our civic tech projects doesn’t get collected, managed, and exported by itself.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The second post is from the Bay Area design firm Stamen, and highlights the need for data visualizations (and other bits of civic technology that rely on open data) to be maintained over time. The post <a href="http://content.stamen.com/a_tale_of_two_cities_maps">uses the analogy of gardening</a> to underscore the need to constantly update and maintain the things we build with data.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If you plant a flower in a garden and then never give it water or light, it will in fact die. Unless, of course, it happens to placed in just the perfect spot, in which case it will need to be pruned. Either way, some kind of tending is always required.</p>
<p>We don’t always think of digital works in the same way, perhaps because their metaphor of creation more closely resembles that of a built object, like a bookcase or building. But even buildings need maintenance, and after so many years, the shelves on the bookcase may falter and need new ones. We need to be more conscious about this aspect of dynamic data visualization, at the outset.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>These two posts call out the need for both the government technology systems that lie at the foundation of open data, and the civic technology that uses this data to get better. To mature. To advance to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, the takeaways from these two posts are pretty clear.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and civic apps are like gardening &#8211; except when they&#8217;re not.</strong></p>
<p>I like the analogy of gardening applied to investment in technology solutions. It underscores the need to continually invest in the maintenance and upkeep of the solutions that are used to consume government data. However, I think there is some danger in using this analogy in that it obscures the the fundamental nature of change in the technology world. </p>
<p>I can tend my garden today in pretty much the same way as someone did 100 years ago &#8211; soil, water and sunshine. Boom. However, when building a technology solution (particularly web-based solutions) its not feasible to use the same approach or components that might have been acceptable as recently as 10 years ago. Budgeting for maintenance and enhancements for technology projects isn&#8217;t a nice to have &#8211; its absolutely essential to their success. The pace of change in the world of technology is just too fast for anything less.</p>
<p><strong>We have to fix the budget process as it relates to investment in technology.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">harped on this before</a>, but we most definitely need to get better at helping non-technology people in government (particularly budget officials) understand the need for continuous support and maintenance of IT projects. Correction &#8211; we need to help them understand technology better in general. Not since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(U.S._TV_series)#Seasons">first season of The Bachelor</a> has there been a worse match than the current public budgeting process and the pace of change in the world of technology.</p>
<p>To understand how acute this problem is, ask some you know that works in state or local government if they (or someone they work with) interacts as part of their job with a technology system that is 10 years old or older. I think the responses would be surprising to many people, and rather alarming to most professional technologists.</p>
<p><strong>Government needs to embrace its role as a data steward</strong></p>
<p>Governments need to understand their role in the civic technology production chain. The current public budgeting and procurement processes make us lousy at investing in the kinds of technology that chance rapidly &#8211; like those that power web-based solutions. </p>
<p>When I read the post by Stamen about their Crimespotting project with the City of Oakland, I see a city that hasn&#8217;t accepted its role as a mature data steward:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;over the years, the project started wavering. Oakland’s API has sputtered to the point of being nonfunctional, rendering Oakland Crimespotting totally spotless.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If governments are serious about open data, they need to invest in systems that will make their data easy to consume and readily available &#8211; without this, the civic technology sector won&#8217;t go far. </p>
<p>I think part of this is <a href="../../2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/index.html">accepting the role of data steward</a>, and engineering our IT infrastructure accordingly. I don&#8217;t know if Stamen&#8217;s was the only project consuming the Oakland crime data API, but building a robust community of users around open data can help public officials see the importance of investing to keep these systems stable and available.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t underestimate the  power of open source</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to helping ensure that civic technology solutions continue to thrive after launch, there is almost nothing better than leveraging the power of open source. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with closed source solutions built on top of open data, but if governments are paying for custom solutions from vendors to display open data we should <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia/myPhillyRising">insist that the underlying code be open sourced</a>. This can go a long way toward helping ensure that it continues to evolve over time, as civic technologists contribute fixes and enhances and (potentially) as other governments fork these solutions for their own use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see the conversation around civic technology and open data focused on how we can take the great work that has been done to the next level. I think it means we&#8217;re ready for the next steps.</p>
