	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about a way to describe what I have seen happening in the world of open data over the past few years, where outside developers create new applications and solutions built with government data to provide a service or transaction that might otherwise be provided by a government agency (or not provided at all). I&#8217;ve taken to describing this phenomenon as &#8220;exoproduction.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Exoproduction</strong> of public services can be said to occur when all or part of a service typically provided by a government or a public sector entity occurs outside of, or exogenous to, the agency of government explicitly (or implicitly) charged with providing that service, or a component of it.</p>
<p>While governments do not directly provide services or information in scenarios where exoproduction occurs, they do make available the raw materials or components necessary for the service to be provided by a third party.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The clearest example of this phenomenon can be observed when looking at information on transit services. Transit authorities are charged with operating and maintaining public transit systems, and as part of their responsibilities they are charged with communicating to current and prospective transit riders the schedules for transit services, the fares for such services and even the current status of various transit assets (e.g., is the R3 train running on time?).</p>
<p>However, through <a href="http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/">deliberate programs</a> designed to share the raw data on transit schedules and real time location information many transit agencies are encouraging the development of third-party applications and solutions that fill this role. A non-trivial and growing number of transit riders <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">obtain information on transit services</a> from a source that is outside the official purview or control of transit authorities.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of other examples where outside parties develop solutions on top of government provided or maintained data &#8211; to fill a role or address an issue that would logically fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. In Philadelphia, there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">repurposing of vacant properties</a>, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to <a href="http://www.phila.gov/pra/about.html">specific government agencies</a>. These outside efforts are enabled by the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/search/?sort=name&amp;dir=asc&amp;qs=property&amp;filter=data">deliberate release of property information</a> by the City of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve used the term &#8220;coproduction&#8221; to refer to this phenomenon, but that term has several decades worth of history behind it and more correctly refers to another scenario where outside actors impact how a government service is provided. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduction_(public_services)">Coproduction</a> assumes that the direct recipients (or consumers) of a government service are involved in making a service more effective or delivered more efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, community policing services may be improved by interacting with residents in a neighborhood. Through these interactions, police may gain insights and information that help them develop better strategies for crime prevention and ultimately provide better service to the community. </p>
<p>Exoproduction differs from this because it frequently involves the development of solutions by those that are not the direct recipient of services. For example, the development of <a href="http://sheltr.org/">an application to find homeless shelters</a> built by a group of young professional at a hackathon.</p>
<p>Government agencies have a variety of strategies for leveraging outside parties to provide direct services to citizens and to fulfill their missions. Most people are familiar with the example of governments using the <a href="http://secure.phila.gov/econtract/">standard procurement process</a> to buy services from outside parties. Many of the technology solutions that are used by governments to provide services and information directly to citizens are built by (or with the help of) outside businesses. </p>
<p>Social service and mental health services may also be provided by outside parties like neighborhood-based agencies or church groups. Some cities have &#8220;business improvement districts&#8221; with <a href="http://www.centercityphila.org/">special authorities</a> established with quasi taxing authority to support things like trash pickup, graffiti removal and security. The list goes on.</p>
<p>However, each of these examples involves the direct oversight or control of government through a formal contract, or through enabling legislation. We need a new definition for what we see happening in the world of open data and civic technology, where the oversight or approval role of government is less direct. </p>
<p>In the more traditional examples above, governments typically provide money &#8211; through a formal contracting process &#8211; to outside parties to act as a proxy on behalf of government for the delivery of a service. With exoproduction, the currency used to drive service delivery is (typically) data.</p>
<p>Having said that, It should be noted that exoproduction may not only occur when software and technology solutions get built on top of government open data &#8211; there are some analog examples where exoproduction can take place. For example, food that is provided to support needy children may be provided through various government programs but is actually dispensed by private individuals outside of public facilities. There is a <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-16/news/33217460_1_prattis-lunch-program-archdiocesan-program">notable example of this</a> from the Philadelphia area that also demonstrates some of the potential challenges with the shift to exoproduction.</p>
<blockquote><p>
A Delaware County woman who voluntarily distributes free food to children from her driveway has run afoul of officials in Chester Township who say her efforts violate zoning ordinances.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this instance, a woman distributing food to needy children through a state-sponsored program administered by a local archdiocese ran afoul of local zoning ordinances. In a way, the issues encountered in this example might be viewed as analogous to <a href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/3263/new-york-mta-threatens-blogger-asserts-copyright-over-schedule/">those encountered by a software developer</a> that scrapes data from public website in order to support a civic application. Actions supported (either directly or tacitly) by one arm of government might encounter resistance from another. </p>
<p>Questions remain about how exoproduction will ultimately impact the way that governments deliver services.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Will solutions developed via exoproduction augment or replace the service provided by government, or relieve governments of the responsibility of providing a service themselves?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">How do we measure the impact or effectiveness of exoproduced solutions, and how does (or how should) this impact how government agencies with official responsibility for providing a service be evaluated?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does (or how should) exoproduction impact the way we budget for or procure solutions through outside parties?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that open data and the phenomenon of exoproduction (or whatever we decide to call it) have the potential to fundamentally change the way that public services are delivered. As governments continue to implement open data programs, it would be worth considering these questions and others that will impact how externally developed solutions are used to improve our communities.</p>

		<p>Nothing in recent memory has focused attention on the need for wholesale reform of the government IT procurement system more than the troubled launch of <a href="http://healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/broken-car.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="broken-car" width="300" height="199" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;"></p>
<p>There has been a myriad of <a href="http://blog.dobt.co/post/63381111778/the-healthcare-gov-fiasco">blog posts</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexhoward/how-the-first-internet-president-produced-american-governmen">stories</a> and <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/politics/from-the-start-signs-of-trouble-at-health-portal.html">articles</a> written in the last few weeks detailing all of the problems that led to the ignominious launch of the website meant to allow people to sign up for health care coverage.</p>
<p>Though the details of this high profile flop are in the latest headlines, the <a href="../../2012/01/23/will-lack-of-procurement-reform-smother-civic-startups/index.html">underlying cause has been talked about many times before</a> &#8211; the process by which governments contract with outside parties to obtain IT services is broken.</p>
<p>The process clearly does not work well for governments &#8211; and many would argue that it does not work well for vendors either. Typical government procurement rules shut out many small firms that may be well positioned to execute on a government IT project but lack the organizational endurance to make it through the selection process.</p>
<p>What are the problems with the government procurement process and how can we fix them? How can we foster more participation in the procurement process by more firms that are qualified to do work? How can we lower the prices that governments pay for IT products and services and help ensure better quality? </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take on the major problems with the current system, and five recommendations for how we can start to fix them.</p>
<h4>The procurement process is too costly and complex</h4>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that it&#8217;s current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualities &#8211; no one would argue that these requirements are aimed at producing positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants. This is true, even if the positive outcomes desired are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for.</p>
<p>The added complexity borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion &#8211; in fact, much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms.</p>
<p>Requirements like <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Proposal+Bond">proposal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond">performance bonds</a>, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth) &#8211; to name just a few &#8211; are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they outsource work to a vendor. In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources.</p>
<p>However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesn&#8217;t seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of IT projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process. For example, many small firms argue that the bond industry doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to underwrite IT projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result &#8211; many smaller firms that may be well qualified to do work simply walk away from the process. This is true even of these provisions don&#8217;t lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of large IT projects.</p>
<p>Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>The use of these risk mitigation provisions at all levels of government helps highlight a more fundamental problem that is at the heart of the broken procurement process in government &#8211; a shocking <a href="../../2013/06/06/the-case-for-making-procurement-harder/index.html">lack of IT knowledge within government</a>. </p>
<p>A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large project &#8211; particularly IT projects &#8211; is to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully.</p>
<h4>The procurement process moves too slowly</h4>
<p>This is actually a fair criticism of government in general, but it is a particularly acute during the procurement process. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia the period between a contract award (a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of that contract (the beginning of actual work) can take an average of four months for some projects.</p>
<p>We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process &#8211; much of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._47">by design</a>. But long procurement and <a href="../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">budget cycles</a> can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that don&#8217;t provide a return for months on end.</p>
<p>There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and that all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to begin work.</p>
<p>An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can might to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.</p>
<h4>Some things we can do to make procurement better</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, here are &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement</strong></p>
<p>Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP (in the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process). In Philadelphia, we&#8217;ve had great success in using these smaller projects to test <a href="../../2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/index.html">new ideas and strategies</a> for partnering with IT vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.</p>
<p>Narrowing the focus of any enhanced thresholds for streamlined budding to web-based projects would help mitigate risk and foster a quicker process for testing new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Identify clear standards for projects</strong></p>
<p>Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic IT standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:5px;">
<li>The various components that a system will use.</li>
<li>The environment in which it will be housed.</li>
<li>The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;can go a long way to reduce the risk an uncertainly inherent in IT projects. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of IT standards that are usually made part of any IT solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date &#8211; they must undergo constant review and refinement. In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard. </p>
<p><strong>Require open source</strong></p>
<p>Requiring that IT projects be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.</p>
<p>In addition, government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source tools &#8211; leveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active community &#8211; to foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia">make the code behind their project open source</a>, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a more robust internal capacity for IT project management and implementation</strong></p>
<p>Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing and managing technology projects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.</p>
<p>Governments need to find ways to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities. </p>
<p><strong>Make contracting, lobbying and campaign contribution data public as open data</strong></p>
<p>One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the analysis of healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/">spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying</a>. It&#8217;s a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firms &#8211; who lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officials &#8211; to simply throw up their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-campaign-finance-data">contributions to political campaigns</a> is open.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all prospective participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possible &#8211; including small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices. </p>
<p>None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near term &#8211; these are items that I personally think are important and very achievable. </p>
<p>One thing that could help speed the adoption of these and other changes is the development of robust communication framework between government contracting and IT professionals in different cities and different states. I think a &#8220;Municipal Procurement Academy&#8221; could go a long way toward achieving this.</p>
<p>Look for more details on a Municipal Procurement Academy &#8211; to train state and local officials on best practices for IT procurement &#8211; in a future post.</p>

		<p>Philadelphia is unique among big cities in how it publishes open data for civic hackers, journalists, entrepreneurs, researchers and other users.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia has designated the community-built <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">Open Data Philly</a> website as it&#8217;s official data directory for open data &#8211; we&#8217;re the only big city in the country (maybe the only city period) that does not unilaterally control the data portal where city departments <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit#heading=h.luv2rrpp5h8d">publish their data</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.gov"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/shutdown.png?w=300&#038;h=183" alt="This website is shut down" width="300" height="183" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></a></p>
<p>Pursuing a strategy like this is <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/09/18/what-happens-to-opendataphilly-now/">not without its challenges</a>, but I believe that it is ultimately a better way to engage the community of users around open data releases. The members of our open data community are all stakeholders in the operation and management of the city&#8217;s open data portal. They can submit new data sources for inclusion in the portal, and they can <a href="https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/pulls">suggest changes</a> in how the platform works.</p>
<p>The federal government shutdown this week &#8211; which resulted in the federal open data site, <a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a>, going offiline &#8211; offers an object lesson in the benefits of community managed open data portals like those in Philadelphia, <a href="http://www.civicdataalliance.org/">Louisville</a>, <a href="http://opencolorado.org/">Colorado</a> and <a href="http://communitydata.io/organization">other places</a>. A government shutdown can&#8217;t impact sites that the government does not unilaterally control.</p>
<p>And this raises some interesting questions &#8211; can an open data initiative be truly open if the government that starts it can shut it down? What happens to an open data portal when municipal leaders that start open data initiatives leave office, are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091500834.html">voted out</a> or are replaced by those that are less enlightened?</p>
<p>Some things to consider as we continue to build our community here in Philly.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, I attended the most recent <a href="http://2013f.pennapps.com/">PennApps hackathon</a> &#8211; a biannual college hackathon in Philadelphia that has grown from somewhat humble beginnings a few years ago to one of the largest college hackathons in the world. </p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/pennapps.png?w=200&#038;h=225" alt="Penn Apps logo" title="Penn Apps logo" width="200" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Attendance at the event has swelled to over 1,000 participants from colleges across the country, as well as several international teams. I&#8217;ve been to PennApps 4-5 times in the past few years and it has been remarkable to see it grow. The last several I have attended, I brought with me colleagues from city government &#8211; some whom had never before been to a hackathon.</p>
<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed over the many installments of PennApps is the presentation of sponsor APIs at the kick off event. After a brief introduction by the organizers, the many technology companies that sponsor the event <a href="http://2013f.pennapps.com/apis.html">show their wares</a> to participants. This almost always involves a short description and demo of an <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> or <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym> that participants can use at the event to build something.</p>
<p>These presentations are witty, engaging and fun &#8211; they have to be. There are dozens of sponsors for the event and each is angling to encourage developers to use their tool or platform to build a working prototype by the end of the weekend. This is how companies built around APIs raise brand awareness. Increasingly, the process of building software has come to revolve around <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">leveraging third-party platforms and APIs</a>. This has changed that way that software development &#8211; particularly web development &#8211; happens, as well as the expectations of developers.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/venmo.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="Venmo makes their pitch at PennApps" title="Venmo makes their pitch at PennApps" width="225" height="300" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Most of the sponsors at an event like this one will offer some sort of additional incentive for developers that use their services &#8211; free credits, t-shirts, swag, etc. At a minimum, though, their services are easy to use and well documented. Those that are brave enough may even try a &#8220;live coding&#8221; demo &#8211; building a working application using their API or platform in just the few short minutes allotted to each sponsor presentation. When done successfully, this can help drive home the point to prospective users that a platform or API is easy to use.</p>
<p>Every time I attend this event with my colleagues from city government I say &#8211; &#8220;This is what governments need to do. We need to present ourselves to prospective users as if we were an API company. The same standards of quality should apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is increasingly common &#8211; and encouraging &#8211; to see governments publish developer portals. A number of different <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources#pages">federal agencies</a> do this, as do large cities like <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/">New York</a>, <a href="http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/developer-resources/">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://phlapi.com/">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is &#8211; if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves &#8211; that most of them are not very good, particularly when compared with the offerings of private companies. Many don&#8217;t have common elements like an <a href="http://developer.washingtonpost.com/docs/services/144/operations/833/console">API console</a>, <a href="http://pusher.com/tutorials">code samples &amp; tutorials</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries">helper libraries</a> or a <a href="http://www.tokbox.com/forums/">discussion forum</a>.</p>
<p>If we want to encourage developers to use open government data we need to be realistic with ourselves about what  developers have come to expect in terms of an API offering. Events like PennApps have raised the bar for anyone that wants to encourage developers to build useful and interesting applications with their data and APIs &#8211; governments included.</p>
<p>We must enhance the quality of government developer portals, and we must work harder (and faster) to develop <a href="../../2013/02/26/on-data-standards-for-cities/index.html">shared standards</a> for government data and APIs. Most importantly, we have to do more to share tips, tricks and best practices between governments. There are <a href="https://github.com/project-open-data/slash_developer">some</a> <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/">tools</a> out there to get governments started down the road of building a developer center that is impactful and engaging, but we must do more.</p>
<p>Developer centers are not just a mandate or requirement that we need to check of our &#8220;to do&#8221; list. Government developer portals should be the hubs around which we engage and communicate with developers, technologists and the broader data community.</p>
<p>In a subsequent post, I&#8217;ll share a checklist that I&#8217;m putting together with a list of basic elements that every government developer portal should have. </p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>The Wall Street Journal recently featured <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324263404578613850076916028.html">an awesome story about civic hacking</a>, focusing on the amazing work being done in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the efforts of civic hackers and open data advocates covered in the mainstream press, and the team in Chicago &#8211; those both inside and outside of city government &#8211; deserve every bit of praise they get for their tremendous efforts. But I did take issue with one point made in the article &#8211; interestingly, one made in the very first sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Cash-strapped cities are turning to an unusual source to improve their online services on the cheap: helpful hackers, who use city data to create tools tracking everything from real-time subway delays to where to get a free flu shot near your home and information about a contentious school-closing plan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue the the fiscal pressure faced by governments &#8211; particularly cities &#8211; hasn&#8217;t helped encourage officials to experiment with new ways to provide services and information, and helped highlight the need for technology innovation. However, I don&#8217;t think its accurate to say that what is happening is an effort by governments to get IT work done by outsiders &#8220;on the cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about building things cheaper, its about building them better. </p>
<p>Implicit in the idea of &#8220;government as a platform&#8221; and the factors that help to drive municipal open data programs is that the <a href="../../2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/index.html">role of governments in the delivery of public services is changing</a> &#8211; toward the role of data steward or API manager, and away from the more traditional role of &#8220;app builder.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the role of data steward is a better one for governments &#8211; most importantly, governments don&#8217;t typically make good bets on technology. They&#8217;re <a href="../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">not set up to do it properly</a>, and as a result its not uncommon to see governments invest in technology that quickly becomes out of date and difficult to manage. This problem is particularly acute in relation to web-based services and applications &#8211; which outside civic technologists are very good at building &#8211; the landscape for developing these kinds of applications changes far too rapidly for governments to realistically stay current.</p>
<p>Governments that focus on becoming data stewards are better able to break out of the cycle of investing in technology that quickly becomes out of date. It is these governments that are <a href="http://phlapi.com/">moving to release open data and deploy APIs</a> to enable outside developers to build applications that can help deliver services and information to citizens. </p>
<p>However, this shift to the role of data steward doesn&#8217;t deobligate governments from investing in technology or skilled staff. It simply means that this investment can be focused within a role that governments are better structured to perform well. Developing the infrastructure and policies to support an open data program and API platform are not necessarily &#8220;cheaper&#8221; but they are a much better technology investment for governments to make.</p>
<p>In another sense, the move to the co-production of technology solutions with outside developers is also about building better applications as opposed to building cheaper ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common for those behind civic technology projects to have <a href="https://recovers.org/about">personal investment in the issues being addressed by their solutions</a>. These developers bring a different perspective to the problems that, in the past, may only have been addressed by governments &#8211; they are stakeholders in the success of our cities.</p>
<p>Engaging outside developers and marshaling the efforts of civic hackers to build new tools and new services to improve our communities is about enhancing the quality of solutions, and <strong>not</strong> lowering their cost. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the awareness of civic hacking and the open data efforts that fuel it getting coverage in the mainstream press. But we still have a ways to go on communicating the more fundamental changes to government this movement entails, and the real benefits we all stand to gain.</p>

Openness in government strengthens our democracy, promotes the delivery of efficient and effective services to the public, and contributes to economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Federal Executive Order on Open Data</a>, Section 1.
</p></blockquote>
<p>People in the open government community talk a lot about the potential and promise of open data. The things that it might enable. The problems it might help fix. The possibilities. </p>
<p>Each new instance where we see open data get used to address a problem facing a city or a community is a testament to its true power, and a validation of the work governments do to open it up and make it usable. When we see open data get put to use in the way that we envision it, it can be a very gratifying thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">new website in Philadelphia</a> focused on the challenge of unused vacant land demonstrates how open data is supposed to work. It&#8217;s built using a variety of <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/about/our-data/">data sources made available by the City of Philadelphia</a>, and it allows people to discover vacant land in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://thepossiblecity.com/lotxlot/">isn&#8217;t the first web site</a> to aggregate data on vacant land in Philadelphia, which underscores how <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2012/03/13/philadelphias-imminent-vacant-land-plan-major-progress-or-major-letdown">pressing an issue</a> it is for our city. One of the things I like most about the site is how it frames information about vacant land with an eye toward reuse. The site tells you the planing and zoning district a property is in, as well as the City Council district.</p>
<p>It tells you if there is a structure on the property by checking it against the city&#8217;s Stormwater Billing system, and if a user thinks it might be suitable to convert into a community garden there are <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/resources/">resources available</a> to assist.</p>
<p>Want to watch a specific property, or <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/organize/">organize neighbors</a> around it? Want to improve the data by <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/photos/add/">uploading a photo</a>, or indicating whether something is reported incorrectly? Want to purchase a property through a <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/pathways/sheriff-sale/">Sheriff Sale</a> or through an arrangement with a private owner? The site has information and resources to assist with all of these.</p>
<p>The site even hints at where the City of Philadelphia should go next with it&#8217;s open data efforts. One of the data sources used by the site is an <a href="http://api.phillyaddress.com/">independently built API</a> for property information. The data powering this API is actually scraped from the City&#8217;s website because it is not currently available as a data download or through a city-owned API. This is something we are currently working to change, but the fact that this site makes use of scraped data underscores the need for the City of Philadelphia to release this data in a more open format.</p>
<p>This site is everything that advocates of open data hope for when they work to make data more readily available and to provide <a href="http://phlapi.com/">documentation on how to use it</a>. What&#8217;s most interesting about it is that not once did the sponsors or developers interact with City IT staff while building it. Data that is truly open means that users don&#8217;t need to ask for permission before they use it, or for instructions on how to use it. </p>
<p>Open data works best when it is readily available for those that need it, to build useful services and apps that help address the challenges facing our communities.</p>
<p>This is the way that open data is supposed to work. </p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>I get this question a lot, particularly from government officials who may still be skeptical about the real benefits.</p>
<p>And though I feel like I&#8217;ve made the open data pitch a thousand times before, working in city government for the past year has focused me on the practical aspects of this question. What are the real, practical benefits that accrue when governments release open data? </p>
<p>Here are three that I think are important.</p>
<p>First, releasing data in open formats can dramatically reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to respond to open record / FOIA requests. For some government agencies, responding to these requests takes a non-trivial amount of time &#8211; particularly if they are not done in a coordinated fashion. I&#8217;ve witnessed agencies first hand manually work through open records requests for the exact same data over and over and over. This makes no sense, especially if the data has already been deemed public and suitable for release. Publishing frequently requested data in an open format allows people to self serve, and preserves internal staff time for more pressing needs.</p>
<p>In addition, if your city, county or state government only maintains data publicly as part of a web document or web site there is a good chance it is being <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">scraped</a>. My experience is that this happens <strong>much</strong> more frequently than most government employees think. Scraping can cause undue burden on your IT infrastructure and undue stress on your IT staff that may be tasked with trying to troubleshoot issues caused by scrapers gone wild.</p>
<p>Second, when governments release data <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/apps/">apps happen</a>. We&#8217;ve <a href="http://phlapi.com/gallery.html">seen this happen</a> with our data releases in Philadelphia, and examples of useful and valuable apps built on open data abound. The potential for app development is greatly increased when there are standards that different governments can adopt &#8211; some good examples are <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">GTFS</a> and <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>, and there are developing standards around <a href="http://open511.org/">traffic data</a>, restaurant <a href="http://www.yelp.com/healthscores">inspections</a> and facilities that dispense <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ikTyX1xWpw86u-xuokEJAGwe-tyKAeYl3qFLw0poAAE/edit?pli=1">inoculations</a> against infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Governments that release open data can leverage both their local developer communities and the efforts of <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/civic-app-flu-shot-viral-open-government/">developers elsewhere</a> to bring useful apps to their citizens. </p>
<p>Finally, governments that share open data with outside consumers lay the foundation for a different, equally important, kind of sharing &#8211; sharing data across government agencies. In Philadelphia we are seeing a number of potentially valuable opportunities surface for different city departments to improve their operations by sharing data originally meant to be shared with outside developers.</p>
<p>Cities &#8211; big ones especially &#8211; are notoriously complex and stovepiped. In Philadelphia, the department that grants property tax exemptions is different than the one that collect property tax payments. What if we could condition the granting of exemptions on whether a property owner was current on their tax payments? Sounds simple, yet because of bureaucratic complexity it often is not. Open data can help correct this, particularly if it is structured for easy use by outside developers as an <a href="http://phlapi.com/">API</a>.</p>
<p>Because Philly has been at this (both formally and informally) for a few years now we&#8217;re starting to identify opportunities to share data across different government entities that serve the city. We&#8217;re in discussions with our local gas utility to provide them with property data from our Office of Property Assessment so that they can verify their account information. In return, we hope to get data on utility accounts that see lots of turnover (suggesting renters moving in an out) and match it against our database of <a href="http://phlapi.com/licenseapi.html#licenses">rental licences</a> &#8211; this might be a nice revenue enhancement opportunity. The possibilities are worth spending time thinking about.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the early stages of seeing internal operational efficiencies grow out of our open data efforts, but we&#8217;re here now because we got started with releasing open data to outside users and civic hackers.</p>
<p>Any government that wants to start down this road will quickly start to see the benefits. They just have to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit">get started</a>.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>A few weeks ago at Personal Democracy Forum, I had the pleasure of <a href="http://personaldemocracy.com/conferences/nyc/2013/program">speaking on a panel</a> discussing &#8220;Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts&#8221; for civic hackers.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/pdf2013_0.png?w=290&#038;h=162" alt="PDF2013" width="290" height="162" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:5px;" /></p>
<p>The makeup of the panel was fantastic, and included smart people like Tom Steinberg from MySociety, Catherine Bracy from Code for America, Erie Myer from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and former Presidential Innovation Fellow Phil Ashlock. All in all, we had a great panel, and a very good discussion about civic hacking and open data &#8211; but something that one of my fellow panelists said has stuck with me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/about-tom-steinberg/">Tom Steinberg</a> remarked during our discussion that the open data movement, which started out <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles">focused primarily on increasing government transparency</a> and opening the kinds of data sets that governments might be reluctant to release to the public, has come to focus increasingly on the release of operational data from government &#8211; things like bus schedules, parking meter locations, library hours and 311 service request details.</p>
<p>This same issue came up not long ago during a discussion of local government open data efforts at <a href="http://transparencycamp.org/">Transparency Camp</a> in Washington, DC, and is often brought up in the context of the <a href="http://integrilicious.tumblr.com/">Open Data vs. Open Government</a> debate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../2012/09/12/3-reasons-to-care-about-open-data/index.html">said before</a>, and I still believe, that in order to support open government we need to have the infrastructure and policies in place to support open data programs. Once we have the technology and policy mechanisms in place to support open data, someone needs to make sure that they are being used (at least in part) to provide greater transparency into how well our public officials are doing their jobs.</p>
<p>As someone tasked with the responsibility of helping to put those technology and policy mechanisms in place, I can say firsthand that there are some qualities of operational data that make these kinds of data releases more popular with both data producers (governments) and data consumers.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/educationhd.jpg?w=290&#038;h=212" alt="Civic Hacking in Baltimore" width="290" height="212" style="float:left;padding:5px;margin-right:10px;" /></p>
<p>Operational data from governments is what is most often turned into <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/apps/">apps</a>. This is usually the data that makes hackathons work, and it is fairly easy to demonstrate to a government data producer the value of releasing this data. When we talk about making the &#8220;business case&#8221; for open data, we are most likely referring to operational data releases. </p>
<p>We can more easily tie this kind of data back to a specific objective or goal of a government agency. We can relate it to <a href="../../2010/06/07/the-economic-promise-of-open-government-data/index.html">economic development efforts</a>. While far from perfect, we can begin to quantify the impact of this kind of data release.</p>
<p>With data that is more purely about transparency, these things can be much harder to do. And for many of the actors in the open data ecosystem &#8211; particularly governments &#8211; this makes these kinds of data releases much less appealing. This means that transparency data releases can take longer to realize and require much more effort to achieve.</p>
<p>There are some notable examples of transparency data releases in the City of Philadelphia that underscore this point. First, the release of data providing details on <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/218/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaints/">complaints against Philadelphia police officers</a>. This data set provides details never before released from the city about the specific nature of complaints against officers and details (including the location) of those making complaints. While far from complete, this data set provides some new insight into an issue that most police departments are reluctant to share publicly.</p>
<p>Another good example is a data set showing the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/247/geographic-market-areas/">geographic market areas</a> used to conduct a citywide reassessment of taxable properties in Philadelphia. This data set provides insight into the methodology used by the city to conduct the property reassessment and in effect allows those outside city government to inspect the quality of the work</a> done by the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/opa/Pages/default.aspx">Office of Property Assessment</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of sheer numbers, these two data releases are small when compared to the <a href="https://trello.com/board/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline/51487d15bb68f5de3b0099b0">many other data sets</a> that have been released by the City of Philadelphia over the past year. Yet both of these data releases required relatively more effort to get done &#8211; the relatively smaller number of transparency data releases belies their value.</p>
<p>There is a temptation in the open data world to evaluate the relative success of a government&#8217;s open data program based on the volume of data releases. I don&#8217;t think we have good metrics yet to capture how well (or not well) open data programs are doing on achieving more fundamental government transparency. I think we need them.</p>
<p>There is a strong case to be made that much of the operational data of governments is valuable and is appropriately released through open data programs. In some cases, this data allows outsiders to evaluate the job that government is doing &#8211; how close to the published schedule are the trains running? How long are 311 service requests open, and in which neighborhoods, before they are resolved?</p>
<p>But I also believe that government officials that are tasked with putting in place the infrastructure necessary for governments to efficiently share data need to be mindful of their duty to enhance government transparency. We need to keep the faith on open data, and stay true to the same principles that helped initiate the movement.</p>
<p>Chief Data Officers and similar public officials carry the dual responsibility of having to release data that helps make government work better, and helps make democracy work better.</p>

		<p>Momentum seems to be building around public sector procurement reform.</p>
<p>Governments are <a href="../../2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/index.html">starting to experiment</a> with new ideas and new approaches to procurement that hold the promise of streamlining the process for bidders and producing better outcomes for public sector purchasers. <a href="http://www.procurely.com/">Startups</a> are emerging with <a href="http://procure.io/">new tools</a> to make the procurement process easier, and the issue is on the radar of public sector <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013/05/07/towards-a-procurement-strategy/">innovators</a>.</p>
<p>But with all of the focus on improving the procurement process &#8211; making it more transparent, more streamlined and simpler for bidders and governments &#8211; I think there is a case to be made that in order to improve the public procurement process <strong>we have to make the process harder</strong>. Let me explain.</p>
<blockquote><p>How can governments responsibly evaluate proposals for work when they are not able to effectively and clearly articulate what it is that they want?</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest problems with procurement is how Requests for Proposals (RFPs) get written. Having written and responded to state and local government RFPs, and having evaluated more vendor proposals than I care to remember, I have a pretty good sense of how most RFPs get developed. </p>
<p>It essentially boils down to this: copy + paste.</p>
<p>Most government RFPs begin as a template that is provided by a procurement or legal department. Much of the content in these templates contains all manner of byzantine legal language that includes specific things vendors must do, information on how and when and in what manner to respond, etc. Much of this language will not change from RFP to RFP, and most governments typically employ language that is tailored to their own local processes and requirements. </p>
<p>The heart of any RFP is what is usually referred to as the &#8220;scope of work&#8221; &#8211; the section of the document that is added to the initial template that describes the specific deliverable(s) that a vendor is to provide. This is the most important part of the procurement document because it describes the thing (or things) that governments want to purchase with taxpayer money.</p>
<p>Yet all to often, this core piece of the RFP document gets cobbled together by looking at other RFPs that have been issued for projects that are further along in the development cycle. If another RFP &#8211; so the logic goes &#8211; was issued, received responses and has moved into the work phase then it might have language that can be reused in a new RFP, particularly if both are for similar kinds of projects.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a government agency or department wants to build a web or mobile app, construct a data warehouse or obtain an analytics tool they simply need to go and find and RFP that was issued for a similar project and use that as the basis for building the scope of work for a new project. And while there is some value in identifying RFPs for similar types of projects to help ensure that language used across different projects is consistent, I think this practice is dangerous and leads to bad technology choices. </p>
<p>Far too often, the process of writing what is essentially the heart of an RFP is done by simply copying and pasting text from other documents that have progressed to a later stage in the process. </p>
<p>This means the author probably has very little idea what they are really asking for &#8211; the process requires no effort on the part of the requesting agency to clearly describe what it is that they hope to get from the RFP. How can governments responsibly evaluate proposals for work when they are not able to effectively and clearly articulate what it is that they want?</p>
<p>This is the part of the procurement process that needs to get harder &#8211; we must avoid the temptation to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2013/05/10/how-to-fix-procurement-3-ask-for-the-right-stuff/">create shortcuts</a> that gloss over this important function of accurately and clearly describing what it is a government agency hopes to get from engaging with an outside vendor.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments are lousy at describing what they want &#8211; particularly from technology vendors &#8211; is that there is a lack of people in government with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government.</p>
<p>Until we find better ways to more broadly raise the technology IQ within governments &#8211; by bringing more hackers and makers inside government, or exposing those already inside to the hacker culture &#8211; we&#8217;ll continue to see copy + paste RFPs and poor technology selection by governments.</p>

		<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>On June 1st and 2nd, cities across the country will take part in a <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">national civic hacking event</a> being coordinated under the auspices of the White House.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/educationhd.jpg?w=288&#038;h=215" title="Civic Hacking in Baltimore" alt="Civic Hacking in Baltimore" width="288" height="215" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Philadelphia and Baltimore &#8211; two cities with long histories of hacking events, and active civic hacking communities &#8211; are both holding local events as part of this national initiative. However, Charm City and the City of Brotherly Love are taking a unique approach to this civic hacking event by collaborating on the development of solutions that can benefit both cities.</p>
<p>Philadelphia and Baltimore are cities that have much in common. The two cities are geographically close, and face many of the same issues and problems. Both have active and growing technology communities, with many interconnections and relationships between the two communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=293&#038;h=198" title="Civic Hacking in Philly" alt="Civic Hacking in Philly" width="293" height="198" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Both cities operate 311 call centers, and make 311 service requests data available through a <a href="http://open311.org/">standard API</a>. Both <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Baltimore</a> have embraced open data, and have encouraged outside developers to use their skills to help make their respective cities better.</p>
<p>The National Day of Civic Hacking represents a unique opportunity for these two cities &#8211; both leaders in the civic hacking and open data movements &#8211; to collaborate and identify common solutions to shared problems.</p>
<p><H3>The Venues</H3></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tp.ticketleap.com/rhok-phily-5/">Philadelphia</a> &#8211; The ExCITe Center of Drexel University, 3401 Market Street</li>
<li><a href="http://gb.tc/events/hack-for-change-baltimore/">Baltimore</a> &#8211; Advertising.com, 1020 Hull Street, Ivory Building</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>On June 1st and 2nd, civic hackers, technologists, activists and others passionate about making Philadelphia and Baltimore work better are being asked to team up on solutions that can benefit both cities.</p>
<p>Mentors and data experts will be on site in both locations and ready to assist teams that want to work on projects that benefit both cities. A live video feed between the two venues is also planned to allow collaboration and information sharing.</p>
<p>Participants in Baltimore are being asked to stand up instances of Philly-based civic applications like <a href="http://philly.councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a> and <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/">Apps for Philly</a>. Participants in Philadelphia are being asked to stand up instances of civic applications currently operational in Baltimore like <a href="http://dailybrief.311labs.org/baltimore">311 Daily Brief</a> and <a href="http://baltimorevacants.appspot.com/">Baltimore Vacants</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond this type of direct intercity app exchange, both cities have large amounts of open data that is available to developers both as static downloads and through APIs. Both cities make data available on crime incidents, transit schedules, polling locations, schools, property ownership, vacant land and buildings, property taxes and 311 service requests.</p>
<p>There is enormous opportunity for the development of new applications and solutions over the course of this event that can be put to immediate use in both cities. But we need your participation to make that happen. Register now to attend either the <a href="http://tp.ticketleap.com/rhok-phily-5/">Philadelphia</a> or <a href="http://gb.tc/events/hack-for-change-baltimore/">Baltimore</a> National Day(s) of Civic Hacking!</p>
