					<description><![CDATA[Mark, 

You hit the nail on the head.

As you know, I&#039;ve been advocating 311s take the lead on open311, not just with traditional vendors like Lagan, Motorola, Oracle, etc. but also with 311 app developers (both internal and external).   

Many 311s we work with had started down the path to developing apps internally and we strongly urged them to adhere to open standards.  Other 311s were contacted by 3rd party app developers and we advised them to insist on Open311.

I predict that Open311 will be rapidly adopted because of 2 key benefits: a) it represents inherent best practices in constituent services and, b)ultimately 311s should be able serve as hot-site backups to one another in the event of emergencies because their transactions will be standardized.

You heard it here first.

					<description><![CDATA[Phil, I&#039;d be glad to continue to make the point in this post on the Open311 discussion forum.

In fact, I made this very point a few weeks back:

http://lists.open311.org/discuss/archive/2010/07/1278574410331/forum_view

I&#039;d be happy to start a new forum topic to continue this discussion if you think it would be worth exploring further. I may do this, as I&#039;m interesting in getting feedback from others on the forum as well.

Also, thanks for the link to the open standards listing on the Open Muni site.  Some good stuff there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, we started to survey information about vendors supporting the specification on the mailing list last week. If you have more information or ideas on strategy to add to the conversation there, that&#039;d be great: 

http://lists.open311.org/discuss/archive/2010/08/1281044120590

Also, governments increasingly have policy that outlines requirements for open standards (like open311) with their technology. You can see an overview of that at:

					<description><![CDATA[Bryan:

That&#039;s great to hear!  That&#039;s bound to make things easier for other municipalities that use Motorola&#039;s solution for their 311 services that want to start emulating what you guys have done in DC.

I do think, though, that enacting some sort of institutional requirement (like in bid and/or contracting specs) is still in the best interest of their customers.

It&#039;s great that Lagan and Motorola have decided to support this.  Other vendors need to follow suit.  

And to the extent that there is a formal specification for Open311, there should probably be a more formal requirement for vendors to support it.

In the same way that vendors can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&#038;ID=13.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;required to comply with standards like section 508&lt;/a&gt; (for disability access to government web sites) they should also be required to support formal standards like Open311.

Just my 2 cents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark,

Motorola actually implemented the Open311 API a month or so ago -- we&#039;ve been testing the release and are about to launch it into production.
