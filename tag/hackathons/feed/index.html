										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a rare thing to get a glimpse inside of a truly creative organization, to learn how it works and to identify lessons that can be applied elsewhere.</p>
<p>A recent New York Times article on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?_r=1">staggering history of innovation at Bell Labs</a> offers a glimpse inside the mind of the man responsible for the &#8220;culture of creativity&#8221; there &#8211; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/addlbios/kelly.html">Mervin Kelly</a>.</p>
<p>Kelly had very specific thoughts about how to create an environment that fostered innovation and new ideas.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;His fundamental belief was that an &#8216;institute of creative technology&#8217; like his own needed a &#8216;critical mass&#8217; of talented people to foster a busy exchange of ideas. But innovation required much more than that. Mr. Kelly was convinced that physical proximity was everything; phone calls alone wouldn’t do. Quite intentionally, Bell Labs housed thinkers and doers under one roof. Purposefully mixed together on the transistor project were physicists, metallurgists and electrical engineers; side by side were specialists in theory, experimentation and manufacturing.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s striking how these same principles can be used to explain the success of coworking spaces (the good ones at any rate). Critical mass is everything &#8211; too few people and it&#8217;s like working at the library; too many and it&#8217;s like working at the corner coffee shop during morning rush.</p>
<p>The proper mix of talent and individuals is also critical to fostering a creative environment &#8211; homogeneity does not breed serendipity.</p>
<p>I think well organized hackathons operate under the same dynamic.</p>
<p><span id="more-280"></span></p>
<p>There are those that disagree with the philosophy that <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/30/practical-hackathons-free-is-not-always-better/">getting an optimal number of people to a hackathon is critical</a> to its success. As long as you get some civicly minded people together to work on some projects, all is well (or so the argument goes).</p>
<p>I think this is flawed thinking &#8211; it&#8217;s not about getting more or less people to a hackathon.  It&#8217;s about getting the <strong>right</strong> number of people, and the right mix of talents &amp; backgrounds to a hackathon.</p>
<p>The success we see around us in coworking spaces, and the lessons we learn from Mervin Kelly of Bell Labs, tell us the getting an optimal number of participants together in close proximity is critical to the success of a creative endeavor.</p>
<p>Hackathon organizers assume the duty of first identifying the optimal number of participants for their event.  This isn&#8217;t always easy, and it&#8217;s far from a scientific discipline.  Knowing your community (and your community of hackers) is critical in determining the optimal number of participants and the right mix of talent.</p>
<p>Hackathon organizers then assume the duty of employing the proper tactics and strategies for attracting a critical mass of people to their event.  Again, this isn&#8217;t always easy and it is far from science &#8211; we are <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/30/practical-hackathons-free-is-not-always-better/">still learning about the best ways to do this</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s comforting to think that any turnout at a civic hackathon is a good thing &#8211; and in many ways, it is. A sparsely attended hackathon is almost always better than no hackathon at all.  </p>
<p>But having the optimal number of participants at an event is critical to it&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>Hackathon organizers have a job to do. Let&#8217;s do it right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I wrote about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2262">a civic hacking event that took place in Philadelphia</a> at the office of <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a>. </p>
<p>The event last year was organized by the team of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> fellows working for the year in Philadelphia.  Exactly one year to the day later, the latest group of fellows working in Philadelphia held another civic hackathon &#8211; also at the offices of Azavea, in the city&#8217;s Callowhill neighborhood.</p>
<p>I described <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/28/the-cfa-effect/">my observations at last year&#8217;s event</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“What I was most impressed with was the ability of this event to highlight to those that were there what is truly possible when government data is open to and usable by developers. It provided an object lesson for all those there in the true potential of civic hacking…</p>
<p>Having the Code for America fellows in Philadelphia, and having them essentially kick start civic coding using city data, has accelerated the awareness of what is possible. I think people would have achieved the awareness that was realized yesterday eventually, but the CfA fellows got people there sooner.</p>
<p>I call it “the CfA Effect.” It was pretty cool to see first hand.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The event this past Saturday provided a good opportunity to gauge the changes that have occurred in Philadelphia since the city embraced open data with gusto under Mayor Michael Nutter, and welcomed it&#8217;s first class of Code for America fellows.</p>
<p><span id="more-263"></span></p>
<p>Based on what I saw at this most recent event, the &#8220;CfA Effect&#8221; has firmly taken hold in Philadelphia &#8211; the philosophy of open government and civic hacking has taken root with a wide array of city officials and employees, many of whom showed up at (and even participated in) the most recent event at Azavea.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nutter.jpg?w=300&#038;h=173" alt="Mayor Michael Nutter" title="Mayor Michael Nutter" width="300" height="173" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>As someone who has organized civic hackathons in the past, one of the biggest challenges I have faced is getting city officials to understand the civic hacking culture, and to understand the goals of a civic hacking event.</p>
<p>There are a surprisingly large number of city officials in Philadelphia who get it. As many as a dozen city officials and employees attended the hackathon this past Saturday &#8211; some to pitch problem statements to the hackers in attendance, some to actually participate in the hacking.  </p>
<p>And one &#8211; their boss &#8211; Mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nutter">Michael Nutter</a> stopped by to see first hand what people were building at the event.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&#8217;s Mayor spent the better part of an hour at the event, visting with each team and &#8211; from what I could hear &#8211; thanking each one for their efforts that day.</p>
<p>That is about as high a compliment as I think can be paid to the efforts of Code for America in general, and in the City of Philadelphia in particular.</p>
<p>Code for America has helped civic hackers storm the city walls (in a good way). City officials, up to and including the Mayor, now look at open data and civic hacking differently &#8211; as a way for the city to collaborate with the broader technology community and civic activists to build innovative solutions.</p>
<p>I still like to call it “the CfA Effect,” and I never get tired of seeing it in action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time on a subway platform or at a bus stop lately, you may have witnessed one of the great success stories of open government data.</p>
<p>All of those people checking the arrival and departure times of trains, trolleys and buses are consuming applications built with open transit data.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;margin:10px;padding:5px;" title="Open data has fundamentally changed how we use transit" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/transit.jpg?w=254&#038;h=203" alt="transit" width="254" height="203" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great example of how open data has changed (and continues to change) the way we use public transit, and the role of transit agencies in developing consumer-facing applications.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://policybythenumbers.blogspot.com/2012/01/transit-transparency-open-data-in.html">really interesting post</a> over on the Google &#8220;Policy by the Numbers&#8221; blog that examines some of the reasons that open transit data has had such a dramatic impact in places where it has been embraced (h/t to O&#8217;Reilly Media&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/digiphile">Alex Howard</a> for the link).</p>
<p><span id="more-191"></span></p>
<p>The post is by Francisca Rojas, research director at the Harvard Kennedy School’s <a href="http://transparencypolicy.net/">Transparency Policy Project</a>. It describes how open data has fostered the development of a new way of thinking about service delivery &#8211; both inside and outside of government agencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>In just a few years, a rich community has developed around [transit] data, with visionary champions for disclosure inside transit agencies collaborating with eager software developers to deliver multiple ways for riders to access real-time information about transit.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some really important lessons that can be drawn from the example of transit data, that open data supporters can use in other areas to encourage both the release of open data and it&#8217;s effective use.</p>
<p>First, open data needs a champion within the agency or organization to evangelize the benefits of releasing such data. In the absence of such a champion, developing a process around the release of open data, and sustaining and growing this process over time, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>If you look at transit agencies that understand the benefits of open data, you will invariably find a visionary thinker inside that agency that does the yeoman&#8217;s work of converting people to the cause. This isn&#8217;t meant to suggest that transit agency employees (or other government employees for that matter) are hostile or resistant to open data &#8211; it&#8217;s just a different way of thinking about the role of government or transit agencies. A visionary thinker on the inside can dramatically improve the chances of success for an open data program.</p>
<p>A good example of such a thinker is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelzaleski">Mike Zaleski</a> &#8211; Director of Emerging and Specialty Technology at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (<a href="http://www.septa.org/">SEPTA</a>). Mike is a true open government leader, and has done great work in advancing the way that SEPTA thinks about open data and transit APIs.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things I&#8217;ve witnessed at SEPTA that has resulted from Mike&#8217;s efforts is a <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/21/septa-developer-showcase-puts-realtime-schedule-apps-on-display-for-transit-agency-officials">change in the culture</a> &#8211; my perception is that people are starting to think differently about SEPTA&#8217;s role in delivering information.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p>Another important factor in the success of open data efforts is the relationship cultivated by the agency with outside software developers. As Rojas states in her post on the Google Policy by the Numbers blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we have seen in our study of transit transparency is that local programmers have been the critical intermediaries, taking raw data and generating a variety of information tools that transit agencies could not have imagined on their own. For other open government initiatives to spark this level of innovation and public benefit, they must identify their audience of information intermediaries and foster those relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that simply releasing data &#8211; standing up an open data portal and filling it with data sets &#8211; is not enough. Governments must reach out to developers and cultivate relationships with them. Developers play a critical role in helping <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/">stretch the traditional notions</a> of what public service delivery is and can be.</p>
<p>Successful open data efforts are built around a community of developers and include strategies for building and nurturing relationships with developers. This development community can be seen as the external &#8220;champion&#8221; of open data &#8211; helping agencies understand how that most important ingredient (ata) can be applied in new and creative ways to help their communities.</p>
<p>Open data needs champions &#8211; inside and outside of government. Those of us pushing for more open government data need to help identify these champions, and celebrate their good work when we do.</p>
<p>Rock on, champions. Rock on!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of smart people asking tough questions about civic hacking and hackathons as the new year begins &#8211; a new year that promises to see lots of action on the civic hacking front.</p>
<p>I think this is a good thing. The more we examine how civic hackathons work and the more we evaluate what they produce, the better we&#8217;ll get at running them and the more we&#8217;ll all get out of them.</p>
<p>A lot happened in the world of civic hacking, open data and hackathons in 2011.  But does all of this activity matter?  Are the events and activities we are seeing in the civic hacking space making a lasting difference?  Is the civic hackathon a construct that we will see used in the long run to promote new ideas and lasting civic change?</p>
<p>In a word, yes. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-27"></span></p>
<h3>Confessions of a Civic Hacker</h3>
<p>First, a bit of a disclaimer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not objective on the subject of civic hackathons.  I was a competitor in the very first <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/">Apps for Democracy</a> that took place under Vivek Kundra in Washington, DC, and I was also a competitor in the first <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/">Apps for America contest</a> put on by the Sunlight Foundation.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_55" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/apps-for-septa/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg" data-orig-size="488,329" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Civic Hacking" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=488" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=1000" alt="Apps for SEPTA" title="Apps for SEPTA"   class="size-full wp-image-55" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg 488w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55" class="wp-caption-text">Apps for SEPTA in Philadelphia</p></div>
<p>Since then, I’ve been a participant in lots of other civic hackathons and coding events as either a participant, organizer or sponsor (sometimes as more than one).</p>
<p>In March, I&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive</a> on the subject of civic hackathons, describing lessons learned at hackathons in 2011 and highlighting strategies for holding successful events in 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written before about the <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/08/open-government-hackathons-matter/">value of hackathons</a>, and tried to dispel what I consider to be <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2307">misconceptions about them</a>, or highlight what I believe is unreasonable in terms of <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1850">expectations for their success</a>.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I think I&#8217;m also a realist about what it takes to deliver real civic change.  I&#8217;ve worked in government before and I understand the challenges and priorities of those in the public sector.  I think a critical evaluation of civic hacking is healthy, and this is a very good time to do it.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to examine the value of civic hacking in general and hackathons in particular, I think looking back on what happened in 2011 is critical.  A lot of very important things in the world of civic hacking took place last year.</p>
<h3>What I saw in 2011</h3>
<p>One of the most important trends I saw last year was the growth in independently organized civic hacking events.  These events were not organized by the local government that was the &#8220;subject&#8221; of the hackathon, and they lacked the large cash prizes of the more traditional municipal hacking event.</p>
<p>These events are different than <a href="http://2011.nycbigapps.com/">NYC Big Apps</a> or <a href="http://www.appsformetrochicago.com/">Apps for Metro Chicago</a> (although those events are pretty cool too).</p>
<p>I wrote about events in <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/29/opengov-year-in-review-philly-edition/">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/30/opengov-year-in-review-baltimore-edition/">Baltimore</a> that I helped organize in earlier posts.  Other locally-organized events took place in <a href="http://hack4reno.com/">Reno, NV </a>and in <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">San Francisco</a>.</p>

<p>These events are important because they are driven by civic activists and hackers that want to make their own cities work better and smarter.  This wasn&#8217;t hackathons foisted onto the local technology community by some well meaning but ill informed elected official or government employee.</p>
<p>This was local hacker communities deciding that they wanted to work on issues that affect their neighborhoods and their cities, and choosing the hackathon as the vehicle to most effectively do it.  That&#8217;s a big deal in my mind.</p>
<p>These events were highly focused on specific problems.  An event in Philadelphia was focused on transit issues; an event in Baltimore focused on education; the series of &#8220;Summer of Smart&#8221; events in San Francisco each focused on a single issue like food and nutrition to health to sustainable energy usage.</p>
<p>Some of these events had unique follow through as well &#8211; circling back to government officials with the outcome of the civic hacking events, highlighting innovative solutions to the people that hold elected or appointed office.</p>
<p>in Philadelphia, an entire day was spent <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/21/septa-developer-showcase-puts-realtime-schedule-apps-on-display-for-transit-agency-officials">showcasing the solutions built by outside developers</a> to the management of the regional transit authority.  In San Francisco, the solutions developed during the Summer of Smart hackathons were <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">presented to the entire slate of candidates running for mayor</a>.</p>
<p>Not only were hackathons independently organized in 2011, in some cases so were the open data repositories for cities.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">the open data</a> site was built and is managed by a private firm &#8211; <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a> &#8211; and the city&#8217;s open data efforts operate under <a href="http://www.openaccessphilly.com/">the stewardship of a group</a> comprised of representatives from the public, private, non-profit and education sectors.</p>
<p>In Chattanooga, TN a <a href="http://openchattanooga.com/">similar approach is developing</a> &#8211; built using the same software platform that was open sourced by the OpenAccessPhilly group in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>All of these events, to one degree or another, helped to galvanize the local technology community in these cities and demonstrate that building software-based solutions with open government data (or helping to liberate such data from outdated government websites) is a highly valuable form of civic engagement.  </p>
<p>This is helping to develop and fortify the civic hacking culture in these cities.  Consider the example of <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/10/05/next-septa-developer-reed-lauber-launches-subway-bus-and-trolley-schedule-app">Reed Lauber of Philadelphia</a>, developer of <a href="http://nextsepta.com/">NextSEPTA</a> (a mobile web app for transit riders):</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Like so many urban developers, I just want to provide resources that make my fellow citizens’ lives a little easier,” he said. “Really, I made it for myself and hope that someone else out there will also find it useful.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or consider the example of Mike Subelsky in Baltimore, the driving force behind an intricate project to combine and refine data on <a href="http://www.subelsky.com/2011/12/who-owns-vacant-properties-in-baltimore.html">property ownership in Baltimore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m looking for awesome ideas for my next startup. I&#8217;m hoping that by solving your problem I&#8217;ll learn enough about your industry/your life that I&#8217;ll stumble onto something that a lot of other people also need, something I could build a business around. You can only get good ideas by working on real problems.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With all of that being said, we are still learning how to run civic hackathons successfully. We will continue to need good ideas and experimentation to help ensure sustainability of the developed projects, and to close the feedback loop with public officials and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>We still have work to do.</p>
<h3>Toward More Sustainable Civic Hacking</h3>
<p>As big a success as 2011 was for civic hacking, 2012 needs to be even bigger.</p>
<p>Will it be the year that civic hackathons move, once and for all, away from large one time cash prizes and towards rewarding winners with the chance to &#8220;live the dream&#8221; and make their weekend project into a viable business?</p>
<p>Will it be the year that more governments step up for real and actively market and promote civic apps built with their open data and APIs?</p>
<p>Will it be the year where we see widespread adoption of common standards across governments that will make it easier and more efficient to build solutions that can be used by multiple governments?</p>
<p>I hope so&#8230;</p>
