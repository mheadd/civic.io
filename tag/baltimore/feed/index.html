										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="http://gb.tc/unwired/">UnWIREd conference</a> in Baltimore this past weekend, and got a chance to watch people that love their city engage in a productive dialog about how to make it better.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unwired-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=217" alt="Dave Troy and Beth Blauer of Baltimore" title="Baltimore UnWIREd" width="300" height="217" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>I have lots of friends in Baltimore, and attending civicly-focused events there is always fun because of the passion and dedication of people in the community. I estimate that I knew more than half of the attendees at the event from previous hackathons and similar events.</p>
<p>I attended the event mainly to serve my own purposes &#8211; I&#8217;ll soon be taking <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/08/13/mark-headd-first-ever-city-of-philadelphia-chief-digital-officer">a new position with the City of Philadelphia</a>, and I wanted to get a sense from those attending UnWIREd of how they see <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">open data from their city</a> being a key ingredient in building solutions to urban problems.</p>
<p><span id="more-2606"></span></p>
<p>The cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia share a lot in common, and face <a href="https://civic.io/2012/04/03/cities-and-the-shadow-of-teotihuacan/">many of the same challenges</a>. There is much that these cities can learn from each other as officials and activists in both places work on solutions to the problems facing their communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unwired-2.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="Place making session at UnWIREd" title="Baltimore UnWIREd" width="224" height="300" style="float:left;padding:5px;margin-right:10px;" /></p>
<p>One gratifying takeaway for me came from a discussion with newly appointed Baltimore CIO, <a href="http://technicallybaltimore.com/news/chris-tonjes-named-chief-technology-officer/">Chris Tonjes</a>. Chris reiterated his interest in a <a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">civic application</a> first developed at a Philadelphia hackathon. He and I have chatted before about it on Twitter, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/mjumbewu">developer</a> is a former Code for America fellow from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hugely satisfying to see the products of Philadelphia hacking events develop into reusable solutions that bring value to other cities. It brought to mind the influence that Baltimore has had on the civic hacking landscape in Philadelphia &#8211; for example, a hugely successful <a href="http://educationhackday.org/">education hackathon in Baltimore</a> last year influenced the development of a <a href="http://eduhackathon.sites.emr.ge/">similarly themed event in Philly</a> several months later.</p>
<p>This osmosis of ideas and solutions between cities is important &#8211; it highlights the shared stake that cities have in finding innovative answers to vexing urban problems. The best allies cities have in identifying solutions to the problems they face are <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/cities">other cities</a>.</p>
<p>Going to be interesting to watch this trend develop and spread from the Mid-Atlantic to other places.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great cities have always had an influence beyond their borders.</p>
<p>This is true not only of contemporary cities like New York, Paris and Beijing but also of ancient cities.  The influence of Rome can still be seen today in the form of ancient roadways and aqueducts. </p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mask.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Teotihuacan Pottery Mask" title="Teotihuacan Pottery Mask" width="320" height="240" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>But whether exporting engineering or religion like ancient Rome, or artwork and pottery like the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan, it&#8217;s important to understand that cities have always been &#8211; and still are &#8211; vital centers of commerce, science, art and culture that have an impact far broader than their municipal footprints.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/04/02/7-steps-to-make-philadelphia-closer-to-being-a-hub-for-social-entrepreneurship">a recent summit in Philadelphia</a> sponsored by the Knight Foundation and Delaware Valley Grantmakers, and organized by TechnicallyPhilly&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/christopherwink">Chris Wink</a>, participants discussed the social and urban challenges facing Philadelphia, and considered the possibility that such challenges might present unexpected opportunities.</p>
<p>Wink&#8217;s <a href="http://christopherwink.com/2011/12/19/social-entrepreneurship-how-philadelphia-could-have-a-regional-distinction-for-startups/">thoughts on this subject</a> are well worth the read, as evidenced by the impressive turnout at this recent event.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending this summit, and one of the most profound realizations I took from it was sparked a comment made by one of my fellow participants.</p>
<p><span id="more-2451"></span></p>
<p>This individual observed that with alarming commonness, for those of us that reside outside of large cities, it is far too easy to see an ownership stake in the assets of these cities, while seeing no ownership stake at all in the problems facing these cities. </p>
<p>The Mid-Atlantic region is an ideal place to observe this phenomenon. There is a fairly tight cluster of large cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC that boast world-class assets. But each of these cities also faces significant problems, and those residing close by often have no personal investment in identifying solutions to the problems facing these cities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to feel a personal connection to places like the Camden Aquarium, the sports complex in South Philadelphia, Baltimore&#8217;s Inner Harbor and the National Mall in DC. But this same &#8220;connectedness&#8221; doesn&#8217;t carry over to the challenges facing these cities.</p>
<p>The Delaware Valley region is home to some of the world&#8217;s most passionate sports fans &#8211; we identify ourselves by our allegiance to our teams, like the Philadelphia Phillies. Yet we feel no personal connection to the problem of <a href="http://www.workers.org/2010/us/philadelphia_1028/">childhood hunger in Philadelphia&#8217;s 1st Congressional District</a> &#8211; which includes Citizen Bank Park, where the Phillies play.</p>
<p>The health and prosperity of our cities affects the well being of people well outside the city limits. The &#8220;Teotihuacan Effect&#8221; is real &#8211; prosperous and healthy cities can elevate an entire region; together they can elevate an entire country.</p>
<p>To those of us that labor to improve how our cities work the challenge is clear. It&#8217;s not about getting people who live outside cities to see urban problems as their own. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting them to realize their own, very personal benefit from finding the solutions to these problems.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun preparing this presentation as well as giving it in Texas last week. I learned a lot from the two events covered in this presentation, and I think a lot of valuable lessons on how to effectively run civic hacking events can be gained from the experience of these two events.</p>
<p>Looking forward to applying the lessons learned in Baltimore and Philadelphia to future civic hacking events!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a series of posts with practical advice for organizing and running hacking events, particularly those focused on building civic apps and using open government data.</p>
<p>These posts will lead up to, and (hopefully) follow <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093">a talk I&#8217;m giving at SWSWi in March</a> discussing the outcome of two civic hackathons I helped organize in 2011 &#8211; one in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/img.sxsw.com/2012/webtiles/sxsw_ia_meet_me.png" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>One of the lessons I took away from my own experience in helping organizing these events (and participating in many others) is that &#8220;free&#8221; does not always mean &#8220;better.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a widely held belief that civic hacking events should be free of charge, to encourage wider participation and to make it as easy as possible for people to join an event.  There is some logic to this belief, and in some cases making an event free to attend is the best approach.  </p>
<p>However, there are some cases where I believe charging people to participate in a civic hacking event can <strong>increase</strong> turnout.  </p>
<p><span id="more-182"></span></p>
<p>In making this contention, I draw on the experience I had with a civic hacking event I helped organize last Summer.  The event was part of a larger BarCamp focused on innovation in journalism, and it seemed to have all the ingredients to draw a large and enthusiastic crowd of participants.  A healthy number of people registered to attend, and expectations were for a big crowd of people at the hackathon.</p>
<p>On the day of the event, however, turnout was very light &#8211; only a handful of people showed up to the hackathon, and only one project was worked on over the course of the day.  (As an aside, I should say that the group that attended was packed with talent and the project they worked on was pretty cool &#8211; but that&#8217;s a story for another post.)</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_55" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/apps-for-septa/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg" data-orig-size="488,329" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Civic Hacking" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=488" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=1000" alt="Apps for SEPTA" title="Apps for SEPTA"   class="size-full wp-image-55" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg 488w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55" class="wp-caption-text">Apps for SEPTA in Philadelphia</p></div>
<p>Civic hackathons are flash points that bring together members of a local (or regional) developer community to rally around open data and civic apps.  As they are meant to help build the civic hacking community, the number of participants in these events is a key measure of their success.  By this measure, the event I am describing was not as successful as I and the other organizers had hoped.</p>
<p>Looking back on this example, I started to believe that one of the reasons we had so many people register to attend and so few actually make it to the event was because there was no cost to blowing it off.  Prospective participants may not have viewed their registration as having any value because we hadn&#8217;t conveyed it to them with the appropriate signals &#8211; i.e., a price for participating.  </p>
<p>As a way of testing this theory, for another hackathon I helped organize later in the year in the same city I decided to limit the number of registations available and to charge a small fee ($10 per participant) for signing up. This was meant to convey to prospective participants that their registration had value, and that by signing up they would be taking a seat in a finite supply &#8211; their participation was, in effect, crowding out someone else who might want to attend.</p>
<p>Charging people to attend civic hacking events (where open government data is used) can be tricky. I had several people who were thinking about attending this event question the motives of organizers, or flat out tell me that they wouldn&#8217;t come. But in the end, we had a sell out crowd for the event, and almost every single registrant showed up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting (and gratifying) to see <a href="http://blog.steren.fr/2012/01/27/hack-days/">other hackathon organizers</a> come to a similar realization.</p>
<blockquote><p>
A hundred people registered to the event, and in the end around 40 hackers showed up for the event. I did not expect such a large difference, I think it’s due to the fact that the event was free of charge, a lot of people registered and never showed up later.</p>
<p>[For the next event, we] decided that tickets would be €10, not to make money from it, but to make sure that people registering were people really willing to come. In the end, around 140 hackers showed up. I think our strategy worked fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though it may seem counterintuitive, sometimes limiting the the number of seats available and charging a fee may increase turnout at a hacking event.  This isn&#8217;t always the case, and there are some very specific instances where this approach is probably not a good fit.</p>
<p>Sending the right signals to prospective participants at a hackathon that their participation is important and has real value can help make these events a success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of smart people asking tough questions about civic hacking and hackathons as the new year begins &#8211; a new year that promises to see lots of action on the civic hacking front.</p>
<p>I think this is a good thing. The more we examine how civic hackathons work and the more we evaluate what they produce, the better we&#8217;ll get at running them and the more we&#8217;ll all get out of them.</p>
<p>A lot happened in the world of civic hacking, open data and hackathons in 2011.  But does all of this activity matter?  Are the events and activities we are seeing in the civic hacking space making a lasting difference?  Is the civic hackathon a construct that we will see used in the long run to promote new ideas and lasting civic change?</p>
<p>In a word, yes. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-27"></span></p>
<h3>Confessions of a Civic Hacker</h3>
<p>First, a bit of a disclaimer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not objective on the subject of civic hackathons.  I was a competitor in the very first <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/">Apps for Democracy</a> that took place under Vivek Kundra in Washington, DC, and I was also a competitor in the first <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/">Apps for America contest</a> put on by the Sunlight Foundation.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_55" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/apps-for-septa/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg" data-orig-size="488,329" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Civic Hacking" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=488" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=1000" alt="Apps for SEPTA" title="Apps for SEPTA"   class="size-full wp-image-55" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg 488w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55" class="wp-caption-text">Apps for SEPTA in Philadelphia</p></div>
<p>Since then, I’ve been a participant in lots of other civic hackathons and coding events as either a participant, organizer or sponsor (sometimes as more than one).</p>
<p>In March, I&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive</a> on the subject of civic hackathons, describing lessons learned at hackathons in 2011 and highlighting strategies for holding successful events in 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written before about the <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/08/open-government-hackathons-matter/">value of hackathons</a>, and tried to dispel what I consider to be <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2307">misconceptions about them</a>, or highlight what I believe is unreasonable in terms of <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1850">expectations for their success</a>.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I think I&#8217;m also a realist about what it takes to deliver real civic change.  I&#8217;ve worked in government before and I understand the challenges and priorities of those in the public sector.  I think a critical evaluation of civic hacking is healthy, and this is a very good time to do it.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to examine the value of civic hacking in general and hackathons in particular, I think looking back on what happened in 2011 is critical.  A lot of very important things in the world of civic hacking took place last year.</p>
<h3>What I saw in 2011</h3>
<p>One of the most important trends I saw last year was the growth in independently organized civic hacking events.  These events were not organized by the local government that was the &#8220;subject&#8221; of the hackathon, and they lacked the large cash prizes of the more traditional municipal hacking event.</p>
<p>These events are different than <a href="http://2011.nycbigapps.com/">NYC Big Apps</a> or <a href="http://www.appsformetrochicago.com/">Apps for Metro Chicago</a> (although those events are pretty cool too).</p>
<p>I wrote about events in <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/29/opengov-year-in-review-philly-edition/">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/30/opengov-year-in-review-baltimore-edition/">Baltimore</a> that I helped organize in earlier posts.  Other locally-organized events took place in <a href="http://hack4reno.com/">Reno, NV </a>and in <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMnoJFQb2xI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>These events are important because they are driven by civic activists and hackers that want to make their own cities work better and smarter.  This wasn&#8217;t hackathons foisted onto the local technology community by some well meaning but ill informed elected official or government employee.</p>
<p>This was local hacker communities deciding that they wanted to work on issues that affect their neighborhoods and their cities, and choosing the hackathon as the vehicle to most effectively do it.  That&#8217;s a big deal in my mind.</p>
<p>These events were highly focused on specific problems.  An event in Philadelphia was focused on transit issues; an event in Baltimore focused on education; the series of &#8220;Summer of Smart&#8221; events in San Francisco each focused on a single issue like food and nutrition to health to sustainable energy usage.</p>
<p>Some of these events had unique follow through as well &#8211; circling back to government officials with the outcome of the civic hacking events, highlighting innovative solutions to the people that hold elected or appointed office.</p>
<p>in Philadelphia, an entire day was spent <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/21/septa-developer-showcase-puts-realtime-schedule-apps-on-display-for-transit-agency-officials">showcasing the solutions built by outside developers</a> to the management of the regional transit authority.  In San Francisco, the solutions developed during the Summer of Smart hackathons were <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">presented to the entire slate of candidates running for mayor</a>.</p>
<p>Not only were hackathons independently organized in 2011, in some cases so were the open data repositories for cities.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">the open data</a> site was built and is managed by a private firm &#8211; <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a> &#8211; and the city&#8217;s open data efforts operate under <a href="http://www.openaccessphilly.com/">the stewardship of a group</a> comprised of representatives from the public, private, non-profit and education sectors.</p>
<p>In Chattanooga, TN a <a href="http://openchattanooga.com/">similar approach is developing</a> &#8211; built using the same software platform that was open sourced by the OpenAccessPhilly group in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>All of these events, to one degree or another, helped to galvanize the local technology community in these cities and demonstrate that building software-based solutions with open government data (or helping to liberate such data from outdated government websites) is a highly valuable form of civic engagement.  </p>
<p>This is helping to develop and fortify the civic hacking culture in these cities.  Consider the example of <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/10/05/next-septa-developer-reed-lauber-launches-subway-bus-and-trolley-schedule-app">Reed Lauber of Philadelphia</a>, developer of <a href="http://nextsepta.com/">NextSEPTA</a> (a mobile web app for transit riders):</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Like so many urban developers, I just want to provide resources that make my fellow citizens’ lives a little easier,” he said. “Really, I made it for myself and hope that someone else out there will also find it useful.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or consider the example of Mike Subelsky in Baltimore, the driving force behind an intricate project to combine and refine data on <a href="http://www.subelsky.com/2011/12/who-owns-vacant-properties-in-baltimore.html">property ownership in Baltimore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m looking for awesome ideas for my next startup. I&#8217;m hoping that by solving your problem I&#8217;ll learn enough about your industry/your life that I&#8217;ll stumble onto something that a lot of other people also need, something I could build a business around. You can only get good ideas by working on real problems.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With all of that being said, we are still learning how to run civic hackathons successfully. We will continue to need good ideas and experimentation to help ensure sustainability of the developed projects, and to close the feedback loop with public officials and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>We still have work to do.</p>
<h3>Toward More Sustainable Civic Hacking</h3>
<p>As big a success as 2011 was for civic hacking, 2012 needs to be even bigger.</p>
<p>Will it be the year that civic hackathons move, once and for all, away from large one time cash prizes and towards rewarding winners with the chance to &#8220;live the dream&#8221; and make their weekend project into a viable business?</p>
<p>Will it be the year that more governments step up for real and actively market and promote civic apps built with their open data and APIs?</p>
<p>Will it be the year where we see widespread adoption of common standards across governments that will make it easier and more efficient to build solutions that can be used by multiple governments?</p>
<p>I hope so&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2012 is shaping up to be the “Year of the Civic Startup.”</p>
<p>With the growth of the open government movement and more and more governments embracing open data, we see an increasing number of useful civic applications being developed.  Every weekend hackathon spawns multiple projects that could potentially live on as a successful venture or company.</p>
<p>Some hackathons are specifically geared toward producing viable companies &#8211; this is exactly the approach that was taken at last November’s “<a href="http://educationhackday.org/">Education Hack Day” in Baltimore</a>.  At that event, the idea was to set up winners with as much expert advice and opportunity as possible to launch a business around their weekend project to help teachers.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a “civic startup” is a startup company with a focus on civic improvement or social good.  They look and act just like other kinds of startups, but their aims are somewhat loftier.  <a href="http://electnext.com/">ElectNext</a> and <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/">SeeClickFix</a> are a good example of a civic startups &#8211; their aim is to become profitable and viable (just like other startups), but if these ventures are successful they will impact people far beyond their direct customer/user base.</p>
<p>Everyone benefits when voters are more engaged and participate more regularly in elections, or when city neighborhoods are cleaned up.  We all get something out of the success of civic startups like ElectNext and SeeClickFix , whether we use them directly or not.  In this sense, we can describe these kinds of startups in economic terms &#8211; civic startups are those that generate a positive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">externality</a>.</p>
<p>Some civic startups are direct consumer of open government data, like <a href="http://www.railbandit.com/mobile-train-schedule.htm">RailBandit</a> which uses data published by public transit agencies.  Other civic startups &#8211; thought this type seems especially rare &#8211; might potentially offer goods and services directly to governments through the standard procurement process.</p>
<p>There are ways that state and local governments can help startups and encourage the startup community.  Some governments (usually at the state level) provide early-stage funding for technology companies &#8211; the <a href="http://www.choosemaryland.org/businessresources/pages/marylandventurefund.aspx">Maryland Venture Fund</a> is a good example of this.  State and local tax policy can also be used foster and encourage high tech startups.  But these options have become more challenging for governments in recent years because of financial strain and tight budgets.</p>
<p>In 2012, I believe that state and local governments will connect the dots on open data and begin to see it as a viable economic development tool for encouraging the development of new businesses and the creation of civic startups.</p>
<p><span id="more-1"></span></p>
<p>Here are five steps that governments can take to help encourage and foster the growth of civic startups in 2012:</p>
<h3>1. View open government data as an economic development tool</h3>
<p>Transparency and visibility are the most common arguments used to justify open government data programs, and the are both strong and compelling.  But there is another argument this is just as compelling &#8211; that by releasing data collected and maintained by government agencies in useful, developer-friendly formats that governments can encourage the development of new businesses.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1782">made this argument before</a>, as have <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/may2010/sb20100526_721134.htm">many others</a>.  It’s time for governments to adopt the mindset that open data is a tool in their economic development tool kits.  This change in thinking will directly impact the quantity and the types of data sets that are opened up for developers to use.</p>
<h3>2. Codify open data requirements</h3>
<p>If entrepreneurs are going to build businesses around open government data, they’ll need certainty that such data will be released in a complete and comprehensive fashion, and that it will continue to be released in the future.  Attracting investment for civic startups will be more difficult without this level of assurance and commitment from governments.</p>
<p>A good example of open government data drying up can be seen in Philadelphia. Until early 2009, the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/health/">Philadelphia Department of Public Health</a> had published a listing of restaurant inspections on its website. This kind of data has been used in several municipalities as the basis for new civic applications, and both <a href="http://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck">New York City</a> publish this information for developers.  However, in early 2009 Philadelphia stopped publishing this information, and the web page where it once resided is <a href="http://www.phila.gov/health/units/ehs/Restaurant_Inspectio.html">no longer active</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard to build a business around data that might not be there in the future. That’s why governments need to formalize their commitment to open data.  Mayoral directives and executive orders &#8211; like <a href="http://www.baltimorecity.gov/OfficeoftheMayor/NewsMedia/tabid/66/ID/883/Mayor_Rawlings-Blake_Signs_Executive_Order_Creating_Open_Data_Initiative_for_City_Government.aspx">Baltimore’s</a> &#8211; are great.</p>
<p>Ideally, however, this commitment should be enacted in statute so that it is less likely to change even with the election of a new mayor or governor.  This will give civic startups greater certainty and allow them to more easily attract investment.</p>
<h3>3. Reform the government procurement process</h3>
<p>I think it’s awesome that public sector CTO’s like Chicago’s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/policy-management/Mayor-Elect-Rahm-Names-John-Tolva-Chicagos-CTO.html">John Tolva</a> are taking about civic startups and encouraging business development through open government data.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.ascentstage.com/archives/2012/01/open-data-in-chicago/">recent blog post</a>, Tolva mentions the <a href="http://chicagolobbyists.org/">Chicago Lobbyists</a> project which is powered by data released by the city.  In his post, Tolva points to the group behind this website’s decision to respond to a city RFP for an online lobbyist registration system as evidence of progress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearly the process was eye-opening. Consider the scenario: a small group of nimble developers with deep subject matter expertise (from their work with the open data) go toe-to-toe with incumbents and enterprise application companies. The promise of expanding the ecosystem of qualified vendors, even changing the skills mix of respondents, is a new driver of the release of City data.</p></blockquote>
<p>As encouraging as this development is, it seems pretty unlikely to have the the desired impact unless significant changes are made to the city’s procurement policies.</p>
<p>In their <a href="http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/2011/12/15/our-response-to-chicagos-lobbyist-rfp/">RFP response</a>, the Chicago Lobbyists group described the Chicago procurement process this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Responding to an RFP for the City of Chicago is a herculean task&#8230; this approach to an RFP results in proposals from one type of contractor: firms that are very large and able to jump through all the hoops that the City has to ensure the minimum amount of risk and liability for the City itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t mean to single out Chicago here &#8211; Tolva and his boss (Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel) are among the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/us/chicagoshovels-web-site-gives-lowdown-on-snow.html">most enlightened public officials</a> in the country when it comes to open data and citizen engagement.  Chicago’s procurement practices are probably more like procurement practices in other cities than they are different.</p>
<p>Pubic procurement policies weren’t built with startups in mind.  But given the vast sums spent by state and local governments on technology and software, this could be an immensely powerful avenue for encouraging new businesses and civic startups.</p>
<h3>4. Showcase civic applications and companies</h3>
<p>One of the most effective and lowest cost steps states and local governments can take to support and encourage civic startups is to showcase civic apps.</p>
<p>I’m always amazed when I see cities &#8211; like Baltimore &#8211; that have robust, developer-ready open data portals yet no centralized listing of apps built with city data.  What’s the point of encouraging developers to use your data if you’re not going to then encourage citizens to use their apps?</p>
<p>Both <a href="http://datasf.org/showcase/">San Francisco</a> and <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/search/?sort=name&amp;dir=asc&amp;filter=application">Philadelphia</a> have nice application showcases that could easily be emulated by Baltimore and other cities.  There are also other, stand alone app directories &#8211; like <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">City-Go-Round</a> for transit apps &#8211; that developers should be encouraged to utilize when promoting their applications.</p>
<h3>5. Manage expectations</h3>
<p>If civic startups are anything like their non-civic counterparts, many of them will fail.  This is the reality of the startup ecosystem &#8211; lots of companies, many of them with great teams, awesome technology and a hot idea, just don’t make it.</p>
<p>The failure of civic startups &#8211; whether powered by open data or selling directly to governments &#8211; shouldn’t be used as the basis for political outrage.  A failed civic startup doesn’t translate into an indictment of a government’s open data program, although some might try to characterize it this way.</p>
<p>Although there isn’t anything to stop those that want to use the failure of civic startups as a way to make political hay, supporters and advocates can go a long way toward mitigating this if expectations are properly managed.</p>
<p>Open data and civic apps aren&#8217;t a panacea for the problems of governments, they are but one tool in the vast toolbox that governments have available to them to provide services to citizens and do all of the other things we expect governments to do.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the idea of civic startups is that if governments embrace open data and encourage it’s widespread use, they may find that they are able to encourage new business development while at the same time making their own burdens a little lighter.</p>
