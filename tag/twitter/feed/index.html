										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big news recently in the Open311 world.  </p>
<p>Lagan &#8211; a technology company that provides solutions for local government, including <a href="http://www.lagan.com/311.aspx">311 systems</a> &#8211; has announced the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/open-government-toolkit-based-on-pioneering-san-francisco-open-311-initiative-to-be-rolled-out-internationally-99756994.html">launch of an integration toolkit</a> to allow &#8220;local government customers worldwide to receive and action service requests via social networks, mobile applications and third-party websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is good news for governments that want to utilize different communication channels to accept and respond to non-emergency service requests, or that want to <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">stand up an API</a> for outside developers to use. </p>
<p>Lagan&#8217;s announcement is based on some pioneering work done in the City of San Francisco to do both of these things &#8211; San Francisco was one of the first (if not <em>the</em> first) city to use <a href="http://twitter.com/sf311">social networking services to take 311 service requests</a>, and they were an early adopter and enthusiastic advocate of the <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311 initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this action by Lagan will catch on with other vendors.  It&#8217;s worth noting that, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts (which <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_report_detail.aspx?id=57562">conducted a study of Philadelphia&#8217;s 311 system</a> earlier this year, and compared it to 14 other large cities with 311 service) that over 30 percent of large municipalities with 311 service share a common vendor &#8211; Motorola.  It would be nice if Motorola would follow Lagan&#8217;s lead on this issue.</p>
<p>Whether or not they do is an open question.  Certainly they have a customer that is as pioneering in their support of Open311 and alternative channels for 311 service as Lagan does (Motorola is the vendor for the <a href="http://api.dc.gov/">District of Columbia</a>).</p>
<p>I continue to believe (and have argued the point with other Open311 advocates) that the best way to &#8220;encourage&#8221; vendors to support integration toolkits like Lagan&#8217;s in their products is to make it a requirement in bidding on 311 projects.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic &#8211; if even one of the large cities that utilize Motorola&#8217;s 311 solution made it a requirement during a contract renewal or an open bid that any 311 solution considered must support integration of multiple communication channels or have a generic interface for implementing an externally facing API it would get done. No question about it.</p>
<p>This position is actually strengthened by Lagan&#8217;s recent announcement.  They have removed any possibility of responding to such a requirement in a bid by saying that no vendor supports such functionality.  There is now a vendor that does &#8211; Lagan.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for governments with 311 services to get tough with their vendors and insist that they support alternate channels for servicing 311 requests and for implementing external API&#8217;s.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several weeks back, I wrote a <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1364">quick post</a> about the new locational functionality being rolled out in Twitter.  Now that this new functionality is being supported by more and more Twitter clients, I think its time for an object lesson in how Twitter&#8217;s new locational feature (and soon <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/facebook-plans-geotag-your-life-too" target="_blank">Facebook&#8217;s</a>) can be used to engage citizens to submit 311 service requests.</p>
<p>Consider the following Tweet (sent using TweetDeck for iPhone):</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/tweet.png" alt="311 Service Request Tweet" title="311 Service Request Tweet" /></p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://twitter.com/statuses/show/7911766753.xml" target="_blank">data behind this Tweet</a> in XML format, courtesy of the Twitter API:</p>
<p>Does this Tweet contain enough information to start a 311 Service request (and by &#8220;start&#8221; I mean via some application logic that automatically parses 311 tweets and requires no human intervention)?  </p>
<p>It has a hashtag describing the nature of the request (<strong>#pothole</strong>), a URL to a picture of the offending pothole (admittedly a pretty wimpy one) and it also has the lat/long of the location where I took the picture.  All together, it took me about 15-20 seconds to take the photo, geotag the Tweet and compose the message.</p>
<p>The Twitter API provides some background information on me, in the event that the government handling this kind of a service request wants or needs it.  If there was really a need for more, it wouldn&#8217;t be all that hard to <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=860">build a Twitter BOT</a> to interact with the person Tweeting the service request and get any additional information that was required.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits for governments from deploying a 311 API, or working with companies like <a href="http://www.citysourced.com/" target="_blank">CitySourced</a> or <a href="http://seeclickfix.com" target="_blank">SeeClickFix</a> is that it can help engage (and empower) citizens to report service requests.  If it&#8217;s quick, easy and convenient to report 311 requests, people will do it and they are more likely to be satisfied with the experience (something that doesn&#8217;t always happen when citizens interact with government).</p>
<p>The new locational feature of Twitter (and soon of Facebook) will provide governments with a very effective way of empowering citizens to report 311 service requests.  </p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how many of the them leverage this as part of their 311 services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months back I wrote a quick post about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=691">tweeting from the command line</a>.  With the recent announcement that Twitter&#8217;s location feature is <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/19/twitter-location-api/" target="_blank">starting to go live</a>, I decided to revisit this idea, with an eye toward adding locational information.</p>
<p>(I am, at heart, a cheapskate &#8211; I could have bought one of the existing Twitter clients that support locational Tweets but I really just want to play around with this new feature for now.  The command line is free, baby!)</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s API methods now support <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-REST-API-Method:-statuses update" target="_blank">adding geographic coordinates</a> with a status update.  Sending out a GeoTweet using the command line is easy (note, this example assumes you know the lat/long of the location you want to associate with your Tweet).</p>
<p>Open up your favorite editor and drop the following into it:</p>
<p><code>curl -s -u user:password -d status="$1" -d lat="$2" -d long="$3"   http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml &gt; /dev/null</code></p>
<p>Save the file and make sure it is executable (chmod u+x fileName). You can execute this file at the command line like this: </p>
<p><code>$ ./fileName "Testing twitter geolocation feature" "+39.754571" "-75.571985"</code></p>
<p>When you examine the properties of this tweet, you will see that it now has geographic information associated with it:</p>
<p><code>&lt;geo xmlns:georss="http://www.georss.org/georss"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;georss :point&gt;39.754571 -75.571985&lt;/georss&gt;<br />
&lt;/geo&gt;</code></p>
<p>How cool is that!</p>
<p>As more Twitter applications (and the Twitter website itself) roll out support for this new feature, a host of <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1176">new Gov 2.0 potential</a> is going to be unlocked.  I think this will have huge implications for services like 311, where location is critical to service requests.  </p>
<p>Municipalities like <a href="http://twitter.com/311nyc" target="_blank">New York City</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sf311" target="_blank">San Francisco</a> that have already incorporated Twitter into their 311 service will have a big head start in this regard.</p>
