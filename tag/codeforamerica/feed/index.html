										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I wrote about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2262">a civic hacking event that took place in Philadelphia</a> at the office of <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a>. </p>
<p>The event last year was organized by the team of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> fellows working for the year in Philadelphia.  Exactly one year to the day later, the latest group of fellows working in Philadelphia held another civic hackathon &#8211; also at the offices of Azavea, in the city&#8217;s Callowhill neighborhood.</p>
<p>I described <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/28/the-cfa-effect/">my observations at last year&#8217;s event</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“What I was most impressed with was the ability of this event to highlight to those that were there what is truly possible when government data is open to and usable by developers. It provided an object lesson for all those there in the true potential of civic hacking…</p>
<p>Having the Code for America fellows in Philadelphia, and having them essentially kick start civic coding using city data, has accelerated the awareness of what is possible. I think people would have achieved the awareness that was realized yesterday eventually, but the CfA fellows got people there sooner.</p>
<p>I call it “the CfA Effect.” It was pretty cool to see first hand.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The event this past Saturday provided a good opportunity to gauge the changes that have occurred in Philadelphia since the city embraced open data with gusto under Mayor Michael Nutter, and welcomed it&#8217;s first class of Code for America fellows.</p>
<p><span id="more-263"></span></p>
<p>Based on what I saw at this most recent event, the &#8220;CfA Effect&#8221; has firmly taken hold in Philadelphia &#8211; the philosophy of open government and civic hacking has taken root with a wide array of city officials and employees, many of whom showed up at (and even participated in) the most recent event at Azavea.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nutter.jpg?w=300&#038;h=173" alt="Mayor Michael Nutter" title="Mayor Michael Nutter" width="300" height="173" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>As someone who has organized civic hackathons in the past, one of the biggest challenges I have faced is getting city officials to understand the civic hacking culture, and to understand the goals of a civic hacking event.</p>
<p>There are a surprisingly large number of city officials in Philadelphia who get it. As many as a dozen city officials and employees attended the hackathon this past Saturday &#8211; some to pitch problem statements to the hackers in attendance, some to actually participate in the hacking.  </p>
<p>And one &#8211; their boss &#8211; Mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nutter">Michael Nutter</a> stopped by to see first hand what people were building at the event.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&#8217;s Mayor spent the better part of an hour at the event, visting with each team and &#8211; from what I could hear &#8211; thanking each one for their efforts that day.</p>
<p>That is about as high a compliment as I think can be paid to the efforts of Code for America in general, and in the City of Philadelphia in particular.</p>
<p>Code for America has helped civic hackers storm the city walls (in a good way). City officials, up to and including the Mayor, now look at open data and civic hacking differently &#8211; as a way for the city to collaborate with the broader technology community and civic activists to build innovative solutions.</p>
<p>I still like to call it “the CfA Effect,” and I never get tired of seeing it in action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the next few weeks civic accelerator programs will be launched in several East Coast cities, building on the momentum started by the announcement of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/">Code for America (CfA) backed civic accelerator in San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/vroom.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" alt="vroom" title="vroom" width="300" height="168" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>As I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/civic_io/status/169742387181129728">telegraphed in a tweet</a> earlier today, announcements for these new efforts are imminent. </p>
<p>Clearly the idea of building viable businesses out of civic projects that use open government data or that leverage government transparency is catching on. What remains to be seen is the specific approach these initiatives will take.</p>
<p>Beyond the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/06/BUCB1MLF3F.DTL">kick off announcement</a> of the San Francisco-based accelerator program, there are very few details of exactly how the effort will work, and CfA is still <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/05/opportunity-build-run-the-cfa-accelerator/">recruiting for someone</a> to lead the venture.</p>
<p>The announcements that will be made on the east coast in the near term will provide more concrete information on exactly how these accelerator programs will work, and offer a glimpse into how supporters believe they can spin civic hacking projects into profitable ventures.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch as the upcoming announcements are made. Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late February and early March, a series of civic hacking events will take place as part of the new <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a> program.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/brigade-logo.png?w=300&#038;h=114" alt="Code for America Brigade" title="Code for America Brigade" width="300" height="114" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>More than a dozen events will take place from Honolulu to Philadelphia and places in between.  </p>
<p>One of the primary goals of this new program from Code for America is to galvanize civic hackers across the country to add to a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/24/checking-in-with-brigade/">growing collection of applications</a> that will make up a new &#8220;Civic Web.&#8221;  The Brigade program in general, and these events specifically, are a great way for groups of coders and technologists in cities across the country to plug in to what is going on in the larger world of civic hacking.  </p>
<p><span id="more-202"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>How does what your local collective of civic hackers is doing line up with what other hackers are focusing on?</li>
<li>Have you always wanted to get a civic hacking movement going in your city, but were unsure of how to get started?</li>
<li>Do you wish your city had an open data catalog like those in other cities that are the centerpiece of far reaching open data efforts?</li>
<li>Do you just like getting together with other technologists to hack on solutions, and you&#8217;d like to try your hand at standing up a civic app to make your neighborhood or city a little better?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any one of these is a great reason to get involved in the Code for America Brigade program.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">signed up to be a part of the Brigade</a>, you should. You can also join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/group/brigade-dev/topics?pli=1">CfA Brigade Google Group</a> and keep up on all that is happening to get ready for the events across the country at the end of the month.</p>
<p>If you live in a city that is planning a Brigade event, you should go. If not, you should consider organizing one &#8211; it&#8217;s not hard to do, and you&#8217;ll get lots of help from the Code for America team.</p>
<p>Join the Brigade and get hacking!</p>
