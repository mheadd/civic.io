										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ordinary telephone is among the most important and ubiquitous technologies in the world.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://www.flyingkitemedia.com/features/incitexchange0221.aspx">inciteXchange</a> &#8211; an annual conference organized by the Center for Design and Innovation at Temple University&#8217;s Fox School of Business. The focus of the event was to bring together speakers on a diverse range of topics to present short talks aimed at inciting collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at this event entitled &#8220;Phone City,&#8221; which underscored the importance of telephones and mobile devices to our everyday lives, and &#8211; I believe &#8211; to the future of our cities.</p>
<p><span id="more-2442"></span></p>
<p><strong>A healthy obsession</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with phones.</p>
<p>Toward the end of my time in state government, about 9 years ago, I helped initiate a project that used previous generation cell phones and standard household phones to help people without Internet access <a href="http://dti.delaware.gov/services/accessloc.shtml">find a public access point</a> (usually a public library) close by.</p>
<p>The project went on to win a national award, and is still active today &#8211; but that&#8217;s not what I think is most notable about this small project begun almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that as we develop increasingly sophisticated tools for people to connect to, interact with, and get services from governments, we continue to struggle with the seemingly intractable problem of the digital divide.  </p>
<p>And despite all the changes in technology we&#8217;ve seen over the last decade, we still rely on the humble telephone in our quest to bridge this divide.</p>
<p><strong>Surrounded by phones</strong></p>
<p>The penetration rate for mobile phones is <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Mobile-Access-2010/Part-2/Internet-use-and-data-applications-using-mobile-phones.aspx">better than 80 percent</a>, while in some cities (like Philadelphia) traditional access to the Internet can be <a href="http://www.phillykeyspots.org/about-us">as low as 60 percent</a>.</p>
<p>And while Internet use on mobile devices is rising, for some services provided by governments and non-profits, having access to a mobile device is an inadequate replacement for traditional internet access. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2011/For-minorities-new-digital-divide-seen.aspx">It&#8217;s been noted before</a> how certain activities, like filing out a job application, filing for unemployment or paying taxes are simply not practical tasks when using a cell phone, regardless of how advanced it is.</p>
<p>However, one of the things that mobile devices are very good for is determining a user&#8217;s location &#8211; this is true both of newer smart phones and (increasingly) older feature phones, using both voice and SMS interfaces.</p>
<p>In light of these factors, phones are an ideal &#8220;bridging&#8221; technology for getting people who don&#8217;t have access to traditional internet devices in their home or at work to a location nearby that does.</p>
<p><strong>Variations on a theme</strong></p>
<p>It comes as no surprise then that we see an abundance of useful applications built for telephones that direct us to all sorts of locations of interest.  And I&#8217;m not just referring to smartphone apps that leverage the geolocation features of more modern phones.</p>
<p>Increasingly apps like <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=snapfresh">SNAPFresh</a>, <a href="http://www.appsformetrochicago.org/apps/techno-finder-0">TechnoFinder</a> and <a href="http://timwis.com/2011/06/phillyvoter/">PhillyVoter</a> to name just a few are using the ubiquity of SMS to provide location information to users, directing them to retailers that accept SNAP benefits, locations in their neighborhoods with free Internet access and polling places.</p>
<p>These applications are the building blocks of the bridge over the digital divide. </p>
<p>Phones have always played an important part in how we communicate with each other, and with our governments. As the cost of telephony services continues to erode, and as the tools for building phone-based apps become more widespread and more powerful, we are bound to see more innovative uses of this very common technology.</p>
<p>Phones are the key to our cities. </p>
<p>Government leaders and civic developers would be wise to consider the long and productive history that phones have played in connecting people to the places of importance to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last two posts, I&#8217;ve provided a basic overview of how to create cloud telephony applications using the <a href="http://tropo.com" target="_blank">Tropo platform</a> and <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>.  </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/couchdb-logo.png" alt="Apache CouchDB Logo" /></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1471">first post</a> of this series, I walked through a quick install of CouchDB and provided information on getting a Tropo account set up.  In the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1510">second post</a>, we created a simple auto attendant Tropo script in PHP that populates a CouchDB database with a call record for each inbound call that is transferred.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll conclude the series with information on how to retrieve information from a CouchDB instance for use in a cloud telephony application, and talk about design documents.  This post will also introduce the reader to the concepts of CouchDB <em>Views</em> and <em>Show Functions</em> &#8211; powerful tools that can be harnessed to create truly cutting edge cloud phone apps.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s create a CouchDB database to hold our call settings.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Call Settings Database</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous CouchDB posts, you can create a new call settings database using <code>curl</code> from the command line, or using the Futon GUI.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;ok&#8221;:true}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can add a record to the call settings database the same way.  This time, however, we&#8217;ll append the URL for our CouchDB database with a document ID, in this case &#8216;1000&#8217; &#8211; this is the extension that a caller to our cloud telephony app will dial.  We&#8217;ll use the document ID and and the CouchDB REST API to get all of the settings we&#8217;ll need to conduct the transfer &#8211; these settings can be seen in the document structure below (feel free to add others to meet your needs or preferences).</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/1000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/1000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Joe&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Blow&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;17777777777&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;Master of Disaster&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;ok&#8221;:true,&#8221;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-0cf5a7c3a70ac5760f1a5d8dcb8b48d2&#8243;}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s add a few more documents to our call settings database (replacing the telephone numbers below with real ones that you want callers to transfer to) and then view all of the documents that we have created.</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/2000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/2000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Harry&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Smith&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;18888888888&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;President of the World&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/3000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/3000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Martin&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Scorsese&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;19999999999&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;The Departed&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>You can view all of the documents in a CouchDB database using the HTTP GET method:</p>
<p>$ curl -X GET <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_all_docs" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_all_docs</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;total_rows&#8221;:3,&#8221;offset&#8221;:0,&#8221;rows&#8221;:[<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-0cf5a7c3a70ac5760f1a5d8dcb8b48d2&#8243;}},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-ee2f09516df8b191a89791b01828d788&#8243;}},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-a1399e8218ae75e1efb73ba3f87862ff&#8221;}}<br />
]}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we need to modify our Tropo PHP script to retrieve the settings we want to use with each transferred call.  </p>
<p>Note, for now we&#8217;ll keep the logic simple &#8211; if a caller enters an extension that does not exist we&#8217;ll get a specific HTTP response back from CouchDB &#8211; something in the 400 class of responses.  If this happens, we&#8217;ll just end the call &#8211; in the real world you&#8217;d want to do something a little more friendly, but you can sort that out when you build your own cloud telephony application. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Tropo Script</strong></p>
<p>So, our new Tropo script looks like this:</p>
<p>Note that the <code>getPhoneNumberByExtension()</code> method no longer returns a hard coded phone number &#8211; it is using the 4-digit extension entered by the caller to access our CouchDB database using the REST API.  The response from CouchDB is a document in JSON format, that we can easily parse using PHP&#8217;s handy <code>json_decode()</code> function.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also modified the value of the $callLog variable to correctly capture some of the variables exposed in the Tropo environment (i.e., the session ID of the call, and the caller ID &#8211; see <a href="http://www.tropo.com/forums/?xt=1262904227270&amp;&amp;bb-cid=99&amp;bb-statusBitToShow=0&amp;bb-tid=1048001#bb" target="_blank">this thread</a> for more information).</p>
<p>So now we have a working cloud telephony application built on Tropo that uses CouchDB to get its call settings, and also to write a call record for billing, reconciliation, etc. </p>
<p>As cool as this is, there is still a lot more we can do with CouchDB in our cloud telephony apps.  Note the constants declared at the top of the Tropo script &#8211; the last two are blank; one for a design document name, and one for a show function.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
define(&#8220;COUCH_DB_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_NAME&#8221;, &#8220;&#8221;);<br />
define(&#8220;COUCH_DB_SHOW_FUNCTION_NAME&#8221;, &#8220;&#8221;);
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about those concepts now, and explore how they could be used in a cloud telephony application.</p>
<p><strong>Getting more out of CouchDB &#8211; Design Documents, Map/Reduce and Show Functions</strong></p>
<p>As the title of this post suggests, we&#8217;re building cloud-based phone applications without SQL.  CouchDB doesn&#8217;t use SQL &#8211; instead it uses a Map/Recuce framework to index documents in a database.</p>
<p>Map functions can be used to emit a key-value listing of documents in a CouchDB database.  Reduce functions are used to aggregate the key-value pairs emitted by a Map function.  Map/Reduce functions (or Views) live inside of a special document in a CouchDB database called a &#8220;<a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/design-documents/design-documents" target="_blank">design document</a>&#8220;, which has a document ID prefixed with &#8220;_design/&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a special design document in our database called &#8220;_design/extensions&#8221; with a View called &#8220;getExtensions&#8221; &#8211; our View is made up of a Map function and (optionally) a Reduce function.  Let&#8217;s assume our View has only a Map function to return data on extensions with valid phone numbers to transfer a caller to.</p>
<blockquote><p>
function(doc) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if(doc.phone.length == 11 &amp;&amp; doc.phone.substr(0,1) == &#8216;1&#8217;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emit(doc._id, doc.phone);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>Our Map function (which is written in JavaScript, and stored in our design document) has one parameter &#8211; <code>doc</code>.  This function is called for each document in our database, and the <code>doc</code> parameter represents the document itself.  As can be seen, we simply examine each document in the database to see if it has a valid phone number (11 digits, starting with 1).</p>
<p>Views are accessed using a specific URI structure (do note, however, that the REST API for querying Views can change significantly between CouchDB versions), and the response is a set of key-value pairs formatted as JSON.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://server_ip_address:5984/database_name/_design/design_document_id/_view/view_name" rel="nofollow">http://server_ip_address:5984/database_name/_design/design_document_id/_view/view_name</a></p>
<p>$ curl -X GET <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_design/extensions/_view/getExtensions" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_design/extensions/_view/getExtensions</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;total_rows&#8221;:3,&#8221;offset&#8221;:0,&#8221;rows&#8221;:[<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;17777777777&#8243;},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;18888888888&#8243;},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;19999999999&#8243;}<br />
]}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check to see if your Map function is working properly by adding a document with an invalid phone number.</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/4000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/4000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Richard&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Kimble&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;4444444&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;The Fugitive&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Accessing the <code>getExtensions</code> view will return the same results as before, as the phone number for the new document does not pass validation.  Using design documents and Views, cloud telephony developers can use CouchDB to build grammars for user input which will significantly enhance the usability of the sample application we&#8217;ve used during the last few posts.</p>
<p>But there is even more potential with another piece of functionality in CouchDB &#8211; <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/design-documents/shows" target="_blank">show functions</a>.  Show function also live in design documents, alongside Views.  Show functions allow a developer to return specifically formatted content from a CouchDB instance, not just data in JSON format.</p>
<p>A basic show function that can be used to return information from our CouchDB database in the format of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/" target="_blank">SRGS grammar</a> might look like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>
function(doc, req) {<br />
&nbsp;var grammer = &#8216;&lt;?xml version=&#8221;1.0&#8243;?&gt;&lt;grammar xmlns=&#8221;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar&#8221;&gt;&#038;#8217" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/2001/06/grammar&#8221;&gt;&#038;#8217</a>;;<br />
&nbsp;grammar += &#8216;&lt;rule id=&#8221;R_1&#8243;&gt;&lt;one-of&gt;&#8217;;<br />
&nbsp;grammar += &#8216;&lt;item&gt;&#8217; + doc.phone + &#8216;&lt;item&gt;&#8217;;<br />
&nbsp;grammar += &#8216;&lt;/one-of&gt;&lt;/rule&gt;&lt;/grammar&gt;&#8217;;<br />
&nbsp;return grammar;<br />
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Views, Show Functions are accessed using a specific URI structure.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://" rel="nofollow">http://</a>{server_ip_address}:5984/{database_name}/_design/{design_document_id}/_show/{show_function_name}/{document_id} </p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the Show function above is different from the Map function discussed earlier in that it takes two parameters &#8211; <code>doc</code> and <code>req</code>.  As before, the <code>doc</code> parameter represents the document the function is called against.  The req parameter represents a parameter that is sent in with the HTTP request, which can be used inside the function to render output.  So a Show function canbe accessed using the above URL with an optional parameter as well, like so.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://" rel="nofollow">http://</a>{server_ip_address}:5984/{database_name}/_design/{design_document_id}/_show/{show_function_name}/{document_id}<strong>?{parameter}={some_value}</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>I hope this series of posts has provided a helpful overview of CouchDB, with an emphasis on how it can be used to build cloud telephony applications.</p>
<p>Cloud telephony platforms like <a href="http://tropo.com" target="_blank">Tropo</a>, <a href="http://cloudvox.com/" target="_blank">CloudVox</a>, <a href="http://www.callfire.com" target="_blank">CallFire</a> and others provide enormous flexibility to developers in building and deploying sophisticated cloud telephony applications.  </p>
<p>Pair these tools with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a> and you&#8217;ve got a powerful combination for building full featured, easy to maintain cloud-based phone apps.</p>
