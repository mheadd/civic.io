										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a communication medium, I think e-mail is making a comeback.  </p>
<div style="float:right;background-color:silver;margin-left:10px;width:45%;padding:15px;">
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t call it a comeback; I&#8217;ve been here for years.<br />
&#8211; Ladies Love Cool James</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I realize this seem patently ridiculous to anyone working furiously towards a state of inbox zero, or that struggles to maintain a reasonable number of unread e-mails in their account.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-118"></span></p>
<p>E-mail has something of a bad rep.  It&#8217;s one of the few channels on which we communicate regularly with others that almost all of us wish we could use less.  We long for newer, faster, more social mediums on which to communicate with our co-workers, families and friends &#8211; Twitter, Facebook, SMS, IM &#8211; the list goes on </p>
<p>These new channels are the communication mediums of Friday night. E-mail is the communication medium of Monday morning.</p>
<p>As an application developer, the idea of building an e-mail app has never really appealed to me. Outside of supporting e-mail as a channel on outbound alerting systems, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve ever delved too deeply into building an app that uses e-mail.  My focus has largely been on more interactive communication apps that use telephones, SMS, XMPP or social networks like Twitter to allow a back and forth between a user and an application (or a human agent transferred from an application).</p>
<p>But recently, I&#8217;ve noticed a change in the way that e-mail applications get built. I might be unconsciously glossing over my own particular biases in this area, but there are now some really cool and very powerful tools for building e-mail applications.</p>
<p>My favorite of late is <a href="http://postmarkapp.com">Postmark</a> &#8211; an awesome service that makes it easy to send outbound and receive inbound e-mails via a simple to use, <a href="http://developer.postmarkapp.com/">well documented API</a>.  Postmark is geared towards &#8220;transactional&#8221; e-mails, not for sending out bulk announcements to a list &#8211; that instantly makes it more appealing to me and gets me thinking about applications I could build with it.</p>
<p>To get more familiar with how inbound e-mail applications can be built with Postmark, I put together <a href="http://blog.postmarkapp.com/post/16179766662/learn-to-use-postmark-inbound-with-node-js-couchdb">a small Node.js + CouchDB application</a> that demonstrates how to receive, process and store inbound messages. It&#8217;s a simple demo, but I think it underscores how easy it is to build a fairly powerful app that would allow for someone to submit a photo to a service that stores and categorizes them.</p>
<p>So why am I writing about e-mail on a blog focused on civic innovation?</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/photo-4.png?w=250&#038;h=375" alt="Crowdsourcing art locations with e-mail apps" title="Crowdsourcing art locations with e-mail apps" width="250" height="375" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;border:1px dashed black;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>Two reasons &#8211; first, with services like Postmark it is now very easy (enjoyable even) to write innovative apps that support transactional e-mail.  Consider the example discussed above &#8211; a simple application that accepts inbound e-mails with photo attachments.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy transition from something like this to an application that allows someone to submit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format#Geolocation">location</a> of a pothole, or graffiti, or a broken parking meter, or the location of a new mural.  </p>
<p>And second, e-mail interaction is a critical component in how people communicate with their governments. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Government-Online.aspx">a 2010 study</a>, the Pew Internet and American Life Project looked at the various methods used by citizens to connect to their governments.  E-mail was found to be an important mode of contacting government officials &#8211; in fact, it&#8217;s importance seems to be growing based on the findings of earlier studies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 2003, 17% of respondents said they preferred to visit a website and 9% preferred sending an email; in our current survey, those who prefer email contact rose to 18% and those who prefer visiting a website fell to 10%.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of discussion going on these days about disrupting government &#8211; using new and innovative applications to change the way that governments operate and interact with citizens.</p>
<p>With services like Postmark, it&#8217;s easy to see how disruptive an e-mail application could be.  </p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ll start to see new disruptive apps for municipal governments based around e-mail very soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/philipashlock">Philip Ashlock</a> of OpenPlans published a nice Open311 &#8220;wish list&#8221; for the new year.</p>
<p>There is a lot of <a href="http://open311.org/2012/01/an-open311-wish-list/">exciting stuff on this list</a>, and Phil&#8217;s thoughts are sure to be the basis for lots of innovative and interesting work in 2012.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/call-center.jpeg?w=275&#038;h=183" alt="311 Contact Center" title="311 Contact Center" width="275" height="183" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>When people think about the &#8220;Open311 standard&#8221; they typically think of the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">GeoReport V2 specification</a>.  This is the spec that details the interface for submitting non-emergency service requests to municipalities. </p>
<p>Reporting potholes, graffiti, garbage on the streets, etc. is often what people envision when they think of municipal 311 service. But this is only part (actually, a relatively small part) of the types of contacts that 311 centers receive. </p>
<p>For most 311 centers, the majority of contacts involve not the reporting of an incident, but an inquiry &#8211; a question about government services or a request for information.</p>
<p><span id="more-98"></span></p>
<h3>Information, not service</h3>
<p>Consider the 311 service center in Philadelphia. In early 2010, the Pew Charitable Trust conducted <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=57568">an in depth review</a> of the first year of operation of <a href="http://www.phila.gov/311/">Philly311</a>.  Looking at the makeup of calls to the 311 service center shows that the overwhelming majority were calls for information, not to request a service.</p>
<blockquote><p>
On average in 2009, seven in ten callers to Phillly311 were looking for basic or general information. On average, 19 percent<br />
needed to be transferred to another department or line, a rate that Philly311 likes to keep low. Another 9 percent were asking<br />
for a service, requiring an agent to submit a formal request to another city department.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Over seventy percent</strong> of calls on average to the Philly311 center were to ask a question, not to report an issue.</p>
<p>Assuming that this experience is similar to 311 operations in other municipalities, the biggest benefits of automation and innovation derived from a 311 API lie in addressing requests for information, not submitting service requests.</p>
<p>To this point, there is a nascent standard for querying data about government services and information &#8211; the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v1">311 Inquiry API</a>.</p>
<p>This developing standard was put forward by officials in New York City, who developed the first iteration of the specification.  There is a new version <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v2_Draft">currently in draft form</a>.</p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>The further development of a 311 Inquiry API and innovation built around it will be hugely important for municipalities running 311 contact centers, and even some that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There is a very real, mesurable cost associated with calls to 311 contact centers.  The Pew report mentioned above reviewed the budget allocations and call volumes of 15 large U.S. cities that run 311 centers.  It estimates the average cost per call to 311 centers over these 15 cities at $3.39 per call.</p>
<p>If self-service applications and utilities can be built on top of a 311 Inquiry API then it may be possible to drive down the volume of telephone calls to 311 contact centers.  But even without a huge reduction in the number of calls, new self-service apps built on a 311 Inquiry API can lead to a better allocation of existing municipal resources. </p>
<p>There are inevitably people that will need to call a 311 center for information that are not able to self serve &#8211; either because of a lack of access to web or mobile apps for self service, or because of some other barrier (e.g., language).</p>
<p>These individuals are most appropriately handled by contact center agents, while other individuals &#8211; those with access to the web or mobile apps &#8211; are more appropriate for self service.  This will ensure that the most expensive and valuable resources in a 311 contact center &#8211; i.e., agents &#8211; are allocated to those citizens who most need more intensive, hands-on help.</p>
<p>Contact center managers certainly don&#8217;t want agents answering inquiries from people who are able to self serve, or who are more easily able to obtain needed information from another source.  This ties up an expensive, finite resource within a contact center with an individual who has other options in how they get their information.</p>
<p>I applaud the good folks at <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a> for all of the hard work they have done, and are doing, to encourage innovation in 311 services. If you havent <a href="http://open311.org/2012/01/an-open311-wish-list/">read Phil&#8217;s Open311 wish list</a> I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>On my own personal 311 wish list for 2012 is one thing &#8211; the further development and use of a 311 Inquiry API.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed that we&#8217;ll see more on this front in the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/06/five-things-governments-can-do-to-encourage-civic-startups/">last post</a>, I made reference to some of the qualities of civic startups &#8211; the special and important things about these kinds of small, agile companies that set them apart from other startups.</p>
<p>I think clarifying what civic startups are (and what they are not), as well as what we expect them to achieve is important.  </p>
<p>Let me be clear, I have great respect for anyone who creates a startup. I have many friends in the technology community who either have, are or will work for a startup company. I do not mean to suggest that civic startups are, generally speaking, &#8220;better&#8221; than other kinds of startups.</p>
<p>What I mean to emphasize is that civic startups have particular qualities that make them attractive to both governments and citizens. Both parties have an interest in seeing these kinds of startups succeed because both will realize benefits when they do.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-41"></span></p>
<p>Civic startups are those companies that, through the pursuit of their core missions, produce what economists call a positive externality. In other words, there are benefits inherent in the services these companies provide that are not reflected in the cost of that service.</p>
<p>This is fairly easy to see when we look at companies like <a href="http://turbovote.org/">TurboVote</a> and <a href="http://electnext.com/">ElectNext</a>, or <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/">SeeClickFix</a> and <a href="http://www.citysourced.com/default.aspx">CitySourced</a>.  Everyone benefits when voters are more engaged and participate more regularly in elections, or when city neighborhoods are cleaned up. </p>
<p>When people use the services of these startups, other people that are not users reap a benefit.  This is exactly the kind of company that governments at all levels should be working to encourage.</p>
<p>Civic startups are also those companies that use government data to take on a role previously fulfilled by governments themselves (or by contractors hired by governments).  This is most easily seen in the development of customer, or citizen-facing software applications.</p>
<p>In the roughly 15 or so years since the Internet became a viable channel through which to provide government service, it was governments themselves that built most of the citizen-facing applications.  With the release of open government data and support for programmable interfaces like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>, we are witnessing an increasing amount of this work being done by independent parties outside of government (and outside of traditional government contract vehicles).</p>
<p>More and more applications that people are using to interact with their governments and consume government services are being built at weekend hackathons, or by startups that want to leverage open data to provide a useful service. Think of applications like <a href="http://youtown.com/">YouTown</a>, that are built on open government data and that provide new ways for people to interact with their governments.  </p>
<p>Instead of governments building these apps directly, or &#8211; by extension &#8211; through a contract with an existing company, governments are increasingly becoming &#8220;data stewards&#8221; responsible for providing the raw materials for building useful civic applications.  This is a major paradigm shift for governments, and civic startups will play a critical role in it.</p>
<p>Governments have traditionally faced limitations in hiring and maintaining top IT talent, and the pace of innovation in software development moves at a rate much different than that of the traditional government procurement process. By embracing open data and APIs, governments are opening the door to smart, civicly-minded, business savvy individuals to fill the void with the latest technologies.</p>
<p>In the case of civic startups built around <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">transit applications</a>, we see both of these qualities of civic startups in evidence.  Transit-focused civic apps are built on data collected and maintained by transit agencies, and by encouraging more transit ridership they generate a benefit even for non-users (less traffic, less pollution from automobiles).</p>
<p>Understanding what civic startups are is important.  Because there are real benefits to be gained from the success of civic startups, governments would seem to have a built in motivation to help them succeed.  To the extent that these startups are easily recognizable, governments will be much more likely to do so.</p>
<p>Having a clear definition of what civic startups are will also help us evaluate their success, and the success of efforts to support them and help them grow. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Big news recently in the Open311 world.  </p>
<p>Lagan &#8211; a technology company that provides solutions for local government, including <a href="http://www.lagan.com/311.aspx">311 systems</a> &#8211; has announced the <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/open-government-toolkit-based-on-pioneering-san-francisco-open-311-initiative-to-be-rolled-out-internationally-99756994.html">launch of an integration toolkit</a> to allow &#8220;local government customers worldwide to receive and action service requests via social networks, mobile applications and third-party websites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is good news for governments that want to utilize different communication channels to accept and respond to non-emergency service requests, or that want to <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">stand up an API</a> for outside developers to use. </p>
<p>Lagan&#8217;s announcement is based on some pioneering work done in the City of San Francisco to do both of these things &#8211; San Francisco was one of the first (if not <em>the</em> first) city to use <a href="http://twitter.com/sf311">social networking services to take 311 service requests</a>, and they were an early adopter and enthusiastic advocate of the <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311 initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this action by Lagan will catch on with other vendors.  It&#8217;s worth noting that, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts (which <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_report_detail.aspx?id=57562">conducted a study of Philadelphia&#8217;s 311 system</a> earlier this year, and compared it to 14 other large cities with 311 service) that over 30 percent of large municipalities with 311 service share a common vendor &#8211; Motorola.  It would be nice if Motorola would follow Lagan&#8217;s lead on this issue.</p>
<p>Whether or not they do is an open question.  Certainly they have a customer that is as pioneering in their support of Open311 and alternative channels for 311 service as Lagan does (Motorola is the vendor for the <a href="http://api.dc.gov/">District of Columbia</a>).</p>
<p>I continue to believe (and have argued the point with other Open311 advocates) that the best way to &#8220;encourage&#8221; vendors to support integration toolkits like Lagan&#8217;s in their products is to make it a requirement in bidding on 311 projects.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be realistic &#8211; if even one of the large cities that utilize Motorola&#8217;s 311 solution made it a requirement during a contract renewal or an open bid that any 311 solution considered must support integration of multiple communication channels or have a generic interface for implementing an externally facing API it would get done. No question about it.</p>
<p>This position is actually strengthened by Lagan&#8217;s recent announcement.  They have removed any possibility of responding to such a requirement in a bid by saying that no vendor supports such functionality.  There is now a vendor that does &#8211; Lagan.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for governments with 311 services to get tough with their vendors and insist that they support alternate channels for servicing 311 requests and for implementing external API&#8217;s.  </p>
