										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent blog post by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/peterkz_swe">Peter Krantz</a> has sparked some interesting dialog on whether governments publishing open data for citizens and application developers need to deploy an Application Programming Interface (API) to their data.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" title="Hello, my name is JSON" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/hello-json.jpg?w=300&#038;h=206" alt="Hello, my name is JSON" width="300" height="206" /></p>
<p>The full post can be <a href="http://www.peterkrantz.com/2012/publishing-open-data-api-design/">viewed here</a>. It provides a nice set of considerations for governments looking at standing up an API to serve data to those that want to build civic apps.</p>
<p>Standing up an API to serve open data is a non-trivial undertaking, and governments would be wise to consider the risks and costs associated with doing it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also suggest that those in government evaluating the best ways to serve open data to end consumers review the details provided in the <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/">Open Data Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>The Handbook (published by the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>) provides a nice summary of the various ways that governments can serve open data, and provides a thorough listing of pros and cons for each:</p>
<blockquote><p>The data should be available as a complete set. If you have a register which is collected under statute, the entire register should be available for download. A web API or similar service may also be very useful, but they are not a substitutes for bulk access.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-305"></span></p>
<p>In the discussion of whether to deploy an open data API or not, it&#8217;s important to keep sight of the fact that API&#8217;s do not obviate the need for governments to provide data in bulk format for download and use by consumers. Even if an agency uses an API (or APIs) there is a legitimate argument for ensuring the availability of data in bulk &#8211; and a number of benefits from providing data in this format as well.</p>
<p>Providing data in bulk is often an effective way to have outside consumers validate data quality. I&#8217;m a lurker on a number of mailing lists for transit agency data, and its a common occurrence on many of these lists for users to remark on data inaccuracies or areas where holes exist. To the credit of these transit agencies, the response to such input is almost always a quick adjustment to the data set.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are some rather compelling reasons why governments might want to consider an API for high-value data, to compliment bulk downloads that might be available.</p>
<p>Chief among them &#8211; it&#8217;s something that developers have come to expect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mashup world and the web is now <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/search/government">programmable</a> &#8211; over the past several years, with the proliferation of so many web-based services behind REST APIs, many developers have come to expect (and even take for granted) that services and data are available through APIs.</p>
<p>In his post on the pros and cons of APIs, Krantz notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[With bulk downloads&#8230;] This means entrepreneurs can get all your data, load it into their own system and design their API according to their use case. Also, high loads will hit their own infrastructure without affecting other apps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There are legions of entrepreneurs and app developers that would rather see high loads hitting someone else&#8217;s infrastructure, rather than their own. In fact, that&#8217;s often the appeal of API-based services &#8211; you can often leave the tricky and complicated business of scaling to someone else, and focus on how an application should work.</p>
<p>If one of the objectives of a government open data program is to attract outside developers to use government data, then government officials must be aware of this strong sentiment in the developer community.</p>
<p>There are a number of good options available for governments that want to provide access to data through an API but are wary of some of the risks associated with doing so.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> &#8211; the open source document-oriented database, stewarded by the Apache foundation &#8211; is so popular in the world of open data is that it has a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Reference#API">powerful REST API</a> baked into it.</p>
<p>The rise of cloud-based hosting services for CouchDB like <a href="http://www.iriscouch.com/">IrisCouch</a> and <a href="https://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a>, and innovative services built on CouchDB (like Max Ogden&#8217;s <a href="http://datacouch.com/">DataCouch</a>) make this an appealing option for governments that want to provide API access to their data.</p>
<p>In addition, services like <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, <a href="http://www.junar.com/">Junar</a> and others provide an easy way for governments to provide both bulk access to their data and <a href="http://opendata.socrata.com/api/docs/">an open API</a> for developers.</p>
<p>This also strikes me as an area where governments can share knowledge &#8211; larger governments with more robust IT infrastructures and larger budgets may already have wrestled with many of the challenges of standing up and managing an API. This knowledge could be invaluable to other governments just getting started on their open data programs.</p>
<p>There also might be opportunities for governments to collaborate and even share infrastructure for open data APIs.</p>
<p>Bulk access to open government data is critical, but the appeal of APIs to application developers is a reality that every government developing an open data program must consider.</p>
<p>APIs aren&#8217;t the only way (or even the most important way) of serving open data to end users and consumers &#8211; but governments should carefully evaluate ways that open data can be served through easy to use, well documented interfaces for application developers.</p>
<p>To API or not to API &#8211; that is the question. Hopefully we are moving toward a place where government officials will have good answers for this important question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the last two posts, I&#8217;ve provided a basic overview of how to create cloud telephony applications using the <a href="http://tropo.com" target="_blank">Tropo platform</a> and <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>.  </p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/couchdb-logo.png" alt="Apache CouchDB Logo" /></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1471">first post</a> of this series, I walked through a quick install of CouchDB and provided information on getting a Tropo account set up.  In the <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1510">second post</a>, we created a simple auto attendant Tropo script in PHP that populates a CouchDB database with a call record for each inbound call that is transferred.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll conclude the series with information on how to retrieve information from a CouchDB instance for use in a cloud telephony application, and talk about design documents.  This post will also introduce the reader to the concepts of CouchDB <em>Views</em> and <em>Show Functions</em> &#8211; powerful tools that can be harnessed to create truly cutting edge cloud phone apps.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s create a CouchDB database to hold our call settings.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Call Settings Database</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous CouchDB posts, you can create a new call settings database using <code>curl</code> from the command line, or using the Futon GUI.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;ok&#8221;:true}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can add a record to the call settings database the same way.  This time, however, we&#8217;ll append the URL for our CouchDB database with a document ID, in this case &#8216;1000&#8217; &#8211; this is the extension that a caller to our cloud telephony app will dial.  We&#8217;ll use the document ID and and the CouchDB REST API to get all of the settings we&#8217;ll need to conduct the transfer &#8211; these settings can be seen in the document structure below (feel free to add others to meet your needs or preferences).</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/1000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/1000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Joe&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Blow&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;17777777777&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;Master of Disaster&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;ok&#8221;:true,&#8221;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-0cf5a7c3a70ac5760f1a5d8dcb8b48d2&#8243;}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s add a few more documents to our call settings database (replacing the telephone numbers below with real ones that you want callers to transfer to) and then view all of the documents that we have created.</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/2000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/2000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Harry&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Smith&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;18888888888&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;President of the World&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/3000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/3000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Martin&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Scorsese&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;19999999999&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;The Departed&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;</p>
<p>You can view all of the documents in a CouchDB database using the HTTP GET method:</p>
<p>$ curl -X GET <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_all_docs" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_all_docs</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;total_rows&#8221;:3,&#8221;offset&#8221;:0,&#8221;rows&#8221;:[<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-0cf5a7c3a70ac5760f1a5d8dcb8b48d2&#8243;}},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-ee2f09516df8b191a89791b01828d788&#8243;}},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:{&#8220;rev&#8221;:&#8221;1-a1399e8218ae75e1efb73ba3f87862ff&#8221;}}<br />
]}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we need to modify our Tropo PHP script to retrieve the settings we want to use with each transferred call.  </p>
<p>Note, for now we&#8217;ll keep the logic simple &#8211; if a caller enters an extension that does not exist we&#8217;ll get a specific HTTP response back from CouchDB &#8211; something in the 400 class of responses.  If this happens, we&#8217;ll just end the call &#8211; in the real world you&#8217;d want to do something a little more friendly, but you can sort that out when you build your own cloud telephony application. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Modifying the Tropo Script</strong></p>
<p>So, our new Tropo script looks like this:</p>
<p>Note that the <code>getPhoneNumberByExtension()</code> method no longer returns a hard coded phone number &#8211; it is using the 4-digit extension entered by the caller to access our CouchDB database using the REST API.  The response from CouchDB is a document in JSON format, that we can easily parse using PHP&#8217;s handy <code>json_decode()</code> function.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also modified the value of the $callLog variable to correctly capture some of the variables exposed in the Tropo environment (i.e., the session ID of the call, and the caller ID &#8211; see <a href="http://www.tropo.com/forums/?xt=1262904227270&amp;&amp;bb-cid=99&amp;bb-statusBitToShow=0&amp;bb-tid=1048001#bb" target="_blank">this thread</a> for more information).</p>
<p>So now we have a working cloud telephony application built on Tropo that uses CouchDB to get its call settings, and also to write a call record for billing, reconciliation, etc. </p>
<p>As cool as this is, there is still a lot more we can do with CouchDB in our cloud telephony apps.  Note the constants declared at the top of the Tropo script &#8211; the last two are blank; one for a design document name, and one for a show function.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
define(&#8220;COUCH_DB_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_NAME&#8221;, &#8220;&#8221;);<br />
define(&#8220;COUCH_DB_SHOW_FUNCTION_NAME&#8221;, &#8220;&#8221;);
</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about those concepts now, and explore how they could be used in a cloud telephony application.</p>
<p><strong>Getting more out of CouchDB &#8211; Design Documents, Map/Reduce and Show Functions</strong></p>
<p>As the title of this post suggests, we&#8217;re building cloud-based phone applications without SQL.  CouchDB doesn&#8217;t use SQL &#8211; instead it uses a Map/Recuce framework to index documents in a database.</p>
<p>Map functions can be used to emit a key-value listing of documents in a CouchDB database.  Reduce functions are used to aggregate the key-value pairs emitted by a Map function.  Map/Reduce functions (or Views) live inside of a special document in a CouchDB database called a &#8220;<a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/design-documents/design-documents" target="_blank">design document</a>&#8220;, which has a document ID prefixed with &#8220;_design/&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a special design document in our database called &#8220;_design/extensions&#8221; with a View called &#8220;getExtensions&#8221; &#8211; our View is made up of a Map function and (optionally) a Reduce function.  Let&#8217;s assume our View has only a Map function to return data on extensions with valid phone numbers to transfer a caller to.</p>
<blockquote><p>
function(doc) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;if(doc.phone.length == 11 &amp;&amp; doc.phone.substr(0,1) == &#8216;1&#8217;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emit(doc._id, doc.phone);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>Our Map function (which is written in JavaScript, and stored in our design document) has one parameter &#8211; <code>doc</code>.  This function is called for each document in our database, and the <code>doc</code> parameter represents the document itself.  As can be seen, we simply examine each document in the database to see if it has a valid phone number (11 digits, starting with 1).</p>
<p>Views are accessed using a specific URI structure (do note, however, that the REST API for querying Views can change significantly between CouchDB versions), and the response is a set of key-value pairs formatted as JSON.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://server_ip_address:5984/database_name/_design/design_document_id/_view/view_name" rel="nofollow">http://server_ip_address:5984/database_name/_design/design_document_id/_view/view_name</a></p>
<p>$ curl -X GET <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_design/extensions/_view/getExtensions" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/_design/extensions/_view/getExtensions</a></p>
<p>You should see a response from CouchDB like this:</p>
<p><strong>{&#8220;total_rows&#8221;:3,&#8221;offset&#8221;:0,&#8221;rows&#8221;:[<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;1000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;17777777777&#8243;},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;2000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;18888888888&#8243;},<br />
{&#8220;id&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;key&#8221;:&#8221;3000&#8243;,&#8221;value&#8221;:&#8221;19999999999&#8243;}<br />
]}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check to see if your Map function is working properly by adding a document with an invalid phone number.</p>
<blockquote><p>
$ curl -X PUT <a href="http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/4000" rel="nofollow">http://your_new_couchdb_ip:5984/call_settings/4000</a> -d &#8216;{&#8220;first_name&#8221;:&#8221;Richard&#8221;,&#8221;last_name&#8221;:&#8221;Kimble&#8221;,&#8221;phone&#8221;:&#8221;4444444&#8243;,&#8221;title&#8221;:&#8221;The Fugitive&#8221;,&#8221;ring_tone&#8221;:&#8221;audio/ring.wav&#8221;}&#8217;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Accessing the <code>getExtensions</code> view will return the same results as before, as the phone number for the new document does not pass validation.  Using design documents and Views, cloud telephony developers can use CouchDB to build grammars for user input which will significantly enhance the usability of the sample application we&#8217;ve used during the last few posts.</p>
<p>But there is even more potential with another piece of functionality in CouchDB &#8211; <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/design-documents/shows" target="_blank">show functions</a>.  Show function also live in design documents, alongside Views.  Show functions allow a developer to return specifically formatted content from a CouchDB instance, not just data in JSON format.</p>
<p>A basic show function that can be used to return information from our CouchDB database in the format of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/" target="_blank">SRGS grammar</a> might look like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Like Views, Show Functions are accessed using a specific URI structure.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://" rel="nofollow">http://</a>{server_ip_address}:5984/{database_name}/_design/{design_document_id}/_show/{show_function_name}/{document_id} </p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the Show function above is different from the Map function discussed earlier in that it takes two parameters &#8211; <code>doc</code> and <code>req</code>.  As before, the <code>doc</code> parameter represents the document the function is called against.  The req parameter represents a parameter that is sent in with the HTTP request, which can be used inside the function to render output.  So a Show function canbe accessed using the above URL with an optional parameter as well, like so.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://" rel="nofollow">http://</a>{server_ip_address}:5984/{database_name}/_design/{design_document_id}/_show/{show_function_name}/{document_id}<strong>?{parameter}={some_value}</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
<p>I hope this series of posts has provided a helpful overview of CouchDB, with an emphasis on how it can be used to build cloud telephony applications.</p>
<p>Cloud telephony platforms like <a href="http://tropo.com" target="_blank">Tropo</a>, <a href="http://cloudvox.com/" target="_blank">CloudVox</a>, <a href="http://www.callfire.com" target="_blank">CallFire</a> and others provide enormous flexibility to developers in building and deploying sophisticated cloud telephony applications.  </p>
<p>Pair these tools with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a> and you&#8217;ve got a powerful combination for building full featured, easy to maintain cloud-based phone apps.</p>
