<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/plug.jpg" alt="" title="Interfacing with Open Government" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin:5px;" /></p>
<p>So, as a prelude to a talk I&#8217;ll be giving at <a href="http://america.ecomm.ec/2010/gov20-communications.php" target="_blank">eComm next month</a>, I wanted to write a post  surveying the landscape of recent government API developments, and also to describe evolving efforts to construct standards for government APIs.</p>
<h3>A Rundown of Recent State and Local API Developments</h3>
<p>At Transparency Camp in DC last weekend, <a href="socrata.com" target="_blank">Socrata</a> &#8211; a firm that hosts open data sets for governments &#8211; open sourced their API for accessing and querying public data.  The <a href="http://www.socrata.com/api/docs" target="_blank">Socrata Open Data API</a> (or SODA) is a specification for running queries against public data sets.  Currently, Socrata hosts data sets for the <a href="http://data.seattle.gov/" target="_blank">City of Seattle</a> and others &#8211; code samples for working with the SODA spec can be found on <a href="http://github.com/socrata" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1643">Open311 API</a> recently implemented by the City of San Francisco (and being implemented by others) got some well deserved attention at the recent <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/where2010/public/schedule/detail/14105" target="_blank">Where 2.0 conference</a>.  Other cities are starting to take note, and some (like <a href="http://www.canadaviews.ca/2010/03/09/edmonton-to-launch-iphone-application/" target="_blank">Edmonton</a> and <a href="http://americancityandcounty.com/technology/311-open-api-20100305/" target="_blank">Boston</a>) look set to be next in line.</p>
<p>One of the early adopters of government APIs &#8211; the NY Senate &#8211; recently announced <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/blogs/2010/mar/31/open-legislation-v15-dusty-daedalus" target="_blank">a new release</a> for their OpenLeg API, which includes some important new changes.  Today the NY Senate remains one of the few (if not the only) state legislative body to adopt an API to open up access to legislative information and proceedings, but other will hopeful soon follow.  (Certainly the work done in Albany by NY Senate CIO <a href="http://twitter.com/ahoppin" target="_blank">Andrew Hoppin</a> and his team has opened the door for work on other government APIs.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of good stuff in just the last few weeks &#8211; I&#8217;ve probably missed some stuff, but I&#8217;m sure there is more to come in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<h3>Towards API Standards</h3>
<p>The work being done on the Open311 API, the <a href="http://www.openmuni.org/" target="_blank">OpenMuni Project</a>, and certainly the move by Socrata to open source the SODA spec will have significant implications for the open government data movement.</p>
<p>Standards for open data and APIs will make it easier for developers to build things &#8211; an app that works for one municipality can work for others if both adhere to a common standard that the app can run against.  But they&#8217;ll also make it easier for governments to open up their data &#8211; standards will offer governments assurance that the time and effort they expend to maintain and publish data or stand up APIs will provide the most return on investment.</p>
<p>The move towards open data and government API standards is an important one that may influence the long-term success of the open government movement.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Next?</h3>
<p>As these standards develop, and as more and more municipalities<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/031010-edmonton-takes-five-steps-towards.html" target="_blank"> start to embrace open data</a>, we&#8217;ll move closer to the idea of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/04/gov-20-its-all-about-the-platform/" target="_blank">government as a platform</a>.</p>
<p>More and more open data will be published by governments in this country and others.  These newly opened data sets may be hosted on infrastructure maintained by governments, or by third parties like Socrata.  Enterprising governments in different regions or states may decide to team up and jointly host data that is of interest or value to constituents served by multiple governments or jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The applications that allow citizens to communicate with governments and consume public services will increasingly be built outside of government.  (By outside, I mean outside the control of government and the government procurement framework.)  Governments will increasingly become the collectors and maintainers of data and information and will focus less on building applications that use such data (or contracting for such applications to be built).</p>
<p>The applications built to consume public data and communicate with government will increasingly be designed as multitenant applications, able to service constituents in multiple jurisdictions that adhere to common data or API standards.  They will also be built using more open source components and Web 2.0 technologies. </p>
<p>And (hopefully) the ranks of civic coders will continue to swell, as technologists looking to &#8220;scratch their own itch&#8221; are empowered to make a difference far beyond their own wants or needs.</p>
<p>All hail the transformative power of standards!</acronym></p>
