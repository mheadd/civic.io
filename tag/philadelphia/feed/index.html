										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="http://gb.tc/unwired/">UnWIREd conference</a> in Baltimore this past weekend, and got a chance to watch people that love their city engage in a productive dialog about how to make it better.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unwired-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=217" alt="Dave Troy and Beth Blauer of Baltimore" title="Baltimore UnWIREd" width="300" height="217" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>I have lots of friends in Baltimore, and attending civicly-focused events there is always fun because of the passion and dedication of people in the community. I estimate that I knew more than half of the attendees at the event from previous hackathons and similar events.</p>
<p>I attended the event mainly to serve my own purposes &#8211; I&#8217;ll soon be taking <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/08/13/mark-headd-first-ever-city-of-philadelphia-chief-digital-officer">a new position with the City of Philadelphia</a>, and I wanted to get a sense from those attending UnWIREd of how they see <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">open data from their city</a> being a key ingredient in building solutions to urban problems.</p>
<p><span id="more-2606"></span></p>
<p>The cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia share a lot in common, and face <a href="https://civic.io/2012/04/03/cities-and-the-shadow-of-teotihuacan/">many of the same challenges</a>. There is much that these cities can learn from each other as officials and activists in both places work on solutions to the problems facing their communities.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/unwired-2.jpg?w=224&#038;h=300" alt="Place making session at UnWIREd" title="Baltimore UnWIREd" width="224" height="300" style="float:left;padding:5px;margin-right:10px;" /></p>
<p>One gratifying takeaway for me came from a discussion with newly appointed Baltimore CIO, <a href="http://technicallybaltimore.com/news/chris-tonjes-named-chief-technology-officer/">Chris Tonjes</a>. Chris reiterated his interest in a <a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">civic application</a> first developed at a Philadelphia hackathon. He and I have chatted before about it on Twitter, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/mjumbewu">developer</a> is a former Code for America fellow from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hugely satisfying to see the products of Philadelphia hacking events develop into reusable solutions that bring value to other cities. It brought to mind the influence that Baltimore has had on the civic hacking landscape in Philadelphia &#8211; for example, a hugely successful <a href="http://educationhackday.org/">education hackathon in Baltimore</a> last year influenced the development of a <a href="http://eduhackathon.sites.emr.ge/">similarly themed event in Philly</a> several months later.</p>
<p>This osmosis of ideas and solutions between cities is important &#8211; it highlights the shared stake that cities have in finding innovative answers to vexing urban problems. The best allies cities have in identifying solutions to the problems they face are <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/cities">other cities</a>.</p>
<p>Going to be interesting to watch this trend develop and spread from the Mid-Atlantic to other places.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, April 28th, the 2nd Philly Tech Week came to a close. </p>
<p>Like the inaugural Philly Tech Week last year, this weeklong series of technology events and panels concluded with a hackathon focused on open government data and journalism.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/hackathon-sign.jpg?w=240&#038;h=320" alt="This way to the hackathon" title="This way to the hackathon" width="240" height="320" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>I gave a brief preview of this event over <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/04/30/building-the-new-civic-hackathon/">on the Code for America blog</a>, and shared some observations on how I thought this event was pushing the boundaries of what the &#8220;traditional&#8221; notion of a hackathon is:</p>
<p>This event &#8211; which took place in conjunction with <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/">BarCamp News Innovation</a> &#8211; was a mashup of journalism unconference and open data hackathon. More clearly than most events, this one underscored the important relationships between civic hackers and journalists, and the common interest they both have in open government data.</p>
<p>In my mind, this event also highlights the maturity of the open data and civic hacking cultures in Philadelphia &#8211; the only city to date to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-partners/philadelphia/">partner with Code for America for two years in a row</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2536"></span></p>
<p>The turnout at the event was awesome &#8211; a large crowd of participants gathered in a set of adjoining TV studios at Annenberg Hall on the Campus of Temple University. The crowd included developer, designers, journalists, data experts and other interested parties.</p>
<p>The sheer number of people at this year&#8217;s event far surpassed last year &#8211; a testament to the growing interest in open data in Philly, and <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/30/practical-hackathons-free-is-not-always-better/">new strategies</a> for attracting an optimal number of hackathon participants.</p>
<p>One of the overarching themes of Philly Tech Week was digital inclusion &#8211; it has been widely stated that <a href="http://www.phillykeyspots.org/">approximately 41 percent of Philadelphia residents</a> lack access to the Internet.  To ensure a focus on this issue at the hackathon, the <a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/">Center for Public Interest Journalism</a>, housed at Temple University, pledged $3,000 in prizes for the best mobile-focused projects.</p>
<p>As a result, 1/2 a dozen viable projects were demoed at the end of the day, most of them with a mobile access focus.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://textblast.org/">TextBlast</a> &#8211; a community organizing tool based around SMS messaging.</li>
<li>Dispatch &#8211; an organizing and survey tool for taxi drivers that uses SMS messaging.</li>
<li><a href="http://lgbtrights.me/">LGBT Rights</a> &#8211; a mobile web application to matches a user&#8217;s location with information on their LGBT rights.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">CouncilMatic</a> &#8211; a web site that allows users to subscribe to information about matters before city council.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/money-talks/">Money Talks</a> &#8211; a web site that will allow detailed analysis of campaign finance reports.</li>
<li><a href="http://sheltr.org/">Sheltr</a> &#8211; an SMS and iPhone interface for the RHoK hackathon-born Sheltr project.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, some of the more powerful takeaways from this event were the diversity of the teams and the focus on previous hackathon projects.</p>
<p>The Money Talks team had a median age that was north of what is typically seen at civic hacking events; The LGBT Rights team included a journalist from the Philly Gay News; the Dispatch team decided on their project focus after hearing from a Philly taxi driver during the morning pitch session.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/hacking.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="Teams hacking at the BCNI hackathon" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>In addition, several of the project &#8211; TextBlast and CouncilMatic &#8211; were born at previous hackathons.  Their creators used this past weekend as a sort of code sprint to further develop their projects and add new features.</p>
<p>The eventual winner of the event was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ahinz">Adam Hinz</a>, who worked on adding an SMS interface and a native iPhone app for the Sheltr project. Sheltr is a project that came out of a <a href="http://www.rhok.org/event/philadelphia-pa-usa">Random Hacks of Kindness event in Philadelphia</a> several months ago.</p>
<p>This underscores how hackathons in Philly &#8211; and elsewhere &#8211; are growing beyond the simple weekend project that gets forgotten after the adrenaline from the event wears off. The hackers behind these projects are continuing to develop them, and are using subsequent hacking events as an opportunity to recruit new talent or add new features.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll continue to see these trends at future events in Philly, and across the country.</p>
<p>More photos from the event are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markheadd/sets/72157629569197794/with/6982535944/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great cities have always had an influence beyond their borders.</p>
<p>This is true not only of contemporary cities like New York, Paris and Beijing but also of ancient cities.  The influence of Rome can still be seen today in the form of ancient roadways and aqueducts. </p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/mask.jpg?w=320&#038;h=240" alt="Teotihuacan Pottery Mask" title="Teotihuacan Pottery Mask" width="320" height="240" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>But whether exporting engineering or religion like ancient Rome, or artwork and pottery like the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacan, it&#8217;s important to understand that cities have always been &#8211; and still are &#8211; vital centers of commerce, science, art and culture that have an impact far broader than their municipal footprints.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/04/02/7-steps-to-make-philadelphia-closer-to-being-a-hub-for-social-entrepreneurship">a recent summit in Philadelphia</a> sponsored by the Knight Foundation and Delaware Valley Grantmakers, and organized by TechnicallyPhilly&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/christopherwink">Chris Wink</a>, participants discussed the social and urban challenges facing Philadelphia, and considered the possibility that such challenges might present unexpected opportunities.</p>
<p>Wink&#8217;s <a href="http://christopherwink.com/2011/12/19/social-entrepreneurship-how-philadelphia-could-have-a-regional-distinction-for-startups/">thoughts on this subject</a> are well worth the read, as evidenced by the impressive turnout at this recent event.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of attending this summit, and one of the most profound realizations I took from it was sparked a comment made by one of my fellow participants.</p>
<p><span id="more-2451"></span></p>
<p>This individual observed that with alarming commonness, for those of us that reside outside of large cities, it is far too easy to see an ownership stake in the assets of these cities, while seeing no ownership stake at all in the problems facing these cities. </p>
<p>The Mid-Atlantic region is an ideal place to observe this phenomenon. There is a fairly tight cluster of large cities like New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC that boast world-class assets. But each of these cities also faces significant problems, and those residing close by often have no personal investment in identifying solutions to the problems facing these cities.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to feel a personal connection to places like the Camden Aquarium, the sports complex in South Philadelphia, Baltimore&#8217;s Inner Harbor and the National Mall in DC. But this same &#8220;connectedness&#8221; doesn&#8217;t carry over to the challenges facing these cities.</p>
<p>The Delaware Valley region is home to some of the world&#8217;s most passionate sports fans &#8211; we identify ourselves by our allegiance to our teams, like the Philadelphia Phillies. Yet we feel no personal connection to the problem of <a href="http://www.workers.org/2010/us/philadelphia_1028/">childhood hunger in Philadelphia&#8217;s 1st Congressional District</a> &#8211; which includes Citizen Bank Park, where the Phillies play.</p>
<p>The health and prosperity of our cities affects the well being of people well outside the city limits. The &#8220;Teotihuacan Effect&#8221; is real &#8211; prosperous and healthy cities can elevate an entire region; together they can elevate an entire country.</p>
<p>To those of us that labor to improve how our cities work the challenge is clear. It&#8217;s not about getting people who live outside cities to see urban problems as their own. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting them to realize their own, very personal benefit from finding the solutions to these problems.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun preparing this presentation as well as giving it in Texas last week. I learned a lot from the two events covered in this presentation, and I think a lot of valuable lessons on how to effectively run civic hacking events can be gained from the experience of these two events.</p>
<p>Looking forward to applying the lessons learned in Baltimore and Philadelphia to future civic hacking events!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I wrote about <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2262">a civic hacking event that took place in Philadelphia</a> at the office of <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a>. </p>
<p>The event last year was organized by the team of <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> fellows working for the year in Philadelphia.  Exactly one year to the day later, the latest group of fellows working in Philadelphia held another civic hackathon &#8211; also at the offices of Azavea, in the city&#8217;s Callowhill neighborhood.</p>
<p>I described <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2011/02/28/the-cfa-effect/">my observations at last year&#8217;s event</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“What I was most impressed with was the ability of this event to highlight to those that were there what is truly possible when government data is open to and usable by developers. It provided an object lesson for all those there in the true potential of civic hacking…</p>
<p>Having the Code for America fellows in Philadelphia, and having them essentially kick start civic coding using city data, has accelerated the awareness of what is possible. I think people would have achieved the awareness that was realized yesterday eventually, but the CfA fellows got people there sooner.</p>
<p>I call it “the CfA Effect.” It was pretty cool to see first hand.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The event this past Saturday provided a good opportunity to gauge the changes that have occurred in Philadelphia since the city embraced open data with gusto under Mayor Michael Nutter, and welcomed it&#8217;s first class of Code for America fellows.</p>
<p><span id="more-263"></span></p>
<p>Based on what I saw at this most recent event, the &#8220;CfA Effect&#8221; has firmly taken hold in Philadelphia &#8211; the philosophy of open government and civic hacking has taken root with a wide array of city officials and employees, many of whom showed up at (and even participated in) the most recent event at Azavea.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nutter.jpg?w=300&#038;h=173" alt="Mayor Michael Nutter" title="Mayor Michael Nutter" width="300" height="173" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>As someone who has organized civic hackathons in the past, one of the biggest challenges I have faced is getting city officials to understand the civic hacking culture, and to understand the goals of a civic hacking event.</p>
<p>There are a surprisingly large number of city officials in Philadelphia who get it. As many as a dozen city officials and employees attended the hackathon this past Saturday &#8211; some to pitch problem statements to the hackers in attendance, some to actually participate in the hacking.  </p>
<p>And one &#8211; their boss &#8211; Mayor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nutter">Michael Nutter</a> stopped by to see first hand what people were building at the event.</p>
<p>Philadelphia&#8217;s Mayor spent the better part of an hour at the event, visting with each team and &#8211; from what I could hear &#8211; thanking each one for their efforts that day.</p>
<p>That is about as high a compliment as I think can be paid to the efforts of Code for America in general, and in the City of Philadelphia in particular.</p>
<p>Code for America has helped civic hackers storm the city walls (in a good way). City officials, up to and including the Mayor, now look at open data and civic hacking differently &#8211; as a way for the city to collaborate with the broader technology community and civic activists to build innovative solutions.</p>
<p>I still like to call it “the CfA Effect,” and I never get tired of seeing it in action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, at the <a href="http://design.temple.edu/">Fox School of Business</a> at Temple University, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter helped launch the Urban Apps &amp; Maps Studio &#8211; a civic business incubator that will support the development of software applications to address urban issues in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The video below &#8211; by former Code for America fellow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/annabloom">Anna Bloom</a> &#8211; provides a nice overview of the focus of the new Apps &amp; Maps Studio.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/35927736" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/35927736">Introducing Urban Apps &amp; Maps Studio</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/annabloom">Anna Bloom</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The Studio, which will be led by Fox School of Business Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/YoungjinYoo">Youngjin Yoo</a>, is <a href="http://www.fox.temple.edu/posts/2011/09/temple-university-receives-700000-in-grants-to-create-urban-apps-maps-studio/">supported by $700,000 in grants from the federal government</a>, and has the support and partnership of the City of Philadelphia and Code for America.</p>
<p><span id="more-224"></span></p>
<p>Leading up to the announcement by Mayor Nutter, the Fox School of Business held it&#8217;s second annual <a href="http://design.temple.edu/designchallenge-2012/">Design Challenge</a> which brings graduate, college and high school students together to identify problems facing the north Broad Street neighborhood (where Temple University is located).</p>
<p>Ideas generated at the Design Challenge will be used as the focus of activities in upcoming hackathon events around the city, and the hope is that these ideas will one day soon return to Temple University in the form of new business ventures to be incubated in the Urban Apps &amp; Maps studio.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ambitious vision, but with the support and partners lined up behind the Studio this looks like it might be the right combination of elements to generate sustainable business ventures around civic solutions.</p>
<p>Ideas from the Design Challenge will be introduced to hackers at an upcoming <a href="http://codeforamerica.ticketleap.com/codeacrossamerica2012/">Code for America hackathon</a> taking place in Philadelphia on February 25th.</p>
<p>It will be exciting to see the outcomes from this important effort. Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a series of posts with practical advice for organizing and running hacking events, particularly those focused on building civic apps and using open government data.</p>
<p>These posts will lead up to, and (hopefully) follow <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093">a talk I&#8217;m giving at SWSWi in March</a> discussing the outcome of two civic hackathons I helped organize in 2011 &#8211; one in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/img.sxsw.com/2012/webtiles/sxsw_ia_meet_me.png" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>One of the lessons I took away from my own experience in helping organizing these events (and participating in many others) is that &#8220;free&#8221; does not always mean &#8220;better.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a widely held belief that civic hacking events should be free of charge, to encourage wider participation and to make it as easy as possible for people to join an event.  There is some logic to this belief, and in some cases making an event free to attend is the best approach.  </p>
<p>However, there are some cases where I believe charging people to participate in a civic hacking event can <strong>increase</strong> turnout.  </p>
<p><span id="more-182"></span></p>
<p>In making this contention, I draw on the experience I had with a civic hacking event I helped organize last Summer.  The event was part of a larger BarCamp focused on innovation in journalism, and it seemed to have all the ingredients to draw a large and enthusiastic crowd of participants.  A healthy number of people registered to attend, and expectations were for a big crowd of people at the hackathon.</p>
<p>On the day of the event, however, turnout was very light &#8211; only a handful of people showed up to the hackathon, and only one project was worked on over the course of the day.  (As an aside, I should say that the group that attended was packed with talent and the project they worked on was pretty cool &#8211; but that&#8217;s a story for another post.)</p>

<p>Civic hackathons are flash points that bring together members of a local (or regional) developer community to rally around open data and civic apps.  As they are meant to help build the civic hacking community, the number of participants in these events is a key measure of their success.  By this measure, the event I am describing was not as successful as I and the other organizers had hoped.</p>
<p>Looking back on this example, I started to believe that one of the reasons we had so many people register to attend and so few actually make it to the event was because there was no cost to blowing it off.  Prospective participants may not have viewed their registration as having any value because we hadn&#8217;t conveyed it to them with the appropriate signals &#8211; i.e., a price for participating.  </p>
<p>As a way of testing this theory, for another hackathon I helped organize later in the year in the same city I decided to limit the number of registations available and to charge a small fee ($10 per participant) for signing up. This was meant to convey to prospective participants that their registration had value, and that by signing up they would be taking a seat in a finite supply &#8211; their participation was, in effect, crowding out someone else who might want to attend.</p>
<p>Charging people to attend civic hacking events (where open government data is used) can be tricky. I had several people who were thinking about attending this event question the motives of organizers, or flat out tell me that they wouldn&#8217;t come. But in the end, we had a sell out crowd for the event, and almost every single registrant showed up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting (and gratifying) to see <a href="http://blog.steren.fr/2012/01/27/hack-days/">other hackathon organizers</a> come to a similar realization.</p>
<blockquote><p>
A hundred people registered to the event, and in the end around 40 hackers showed up for the event. I did not expect such a large difference, I think it’s due to the fact that the event was free of charge, a lot of people registered and never showed up later.</p>
<p>[For the next event, we] decided that tickets would be €10, not to make money from it, but to make sure that people registering were people really willing to come. In the end, around 140 hackers showed up. I think our strategy worked fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though it may seem counterintuitive, sometimes limiting the the number of seats available and charging a fee may increase turnout at a hacking event.  This isn&#8217;t always the case, and there are some very specific instances where this approach is probably not a good fit.</p>
<p>Sending the right signals to prospective participants at a hackathon that their participation is important and has real value can help make these events a success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/philipashlock">Philip Ashlock</a> of OpenPlans published a nice Open311 &#8220;wish list&#8221; for the new year.</p>
<p>There is a lot of <a href="http://open311.org/2012/01/an-open311-wish-list/">exciting stuff on this list</a>, and Phil&#8217;s thoughts are sure to be the basis for lots of innovative and interesting work in 2012.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/call-center.jpeg?w=275&#038;h=183" alt="311 Contact Center" title="311 Contact Center" width="275" height="183" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>When people think about the &#8220;Open311 standard&#8221; they typically think of the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2">GeoReport V2 specification</a>.  This is the spec that details the interface for submitting non-emergency service requests to municipalities. </p>
<p>Reporting potholes, graffiti, garbage on the streets, etc. is often what people envision when they think of municipal 311 service. But this is only part (actually, a relatively small part) of the types of contacts that 311 centers receive. </p>
<p>For most 311 centers, the majority of contacts involve not the reporting of an incident, but an inquiry &#8211; a question about government services or a request for information.</p>
<p><span id="more-98"></span></p>
<h3>Information, not service</h3>
<p>Consider the 311 service center in Philadelphia. In early 2010, the Pew Charitable Trust conducted <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=57568">an in depth review</a> of the first year of operation of <a href="http://www.phila.gov/311/">Philly311</a>.  Looking at the makeup of calls to the 311 service center shows that the overwhelming majority were calls for information, not to request a service.</p>
<blockquote><p>
On average in 2009, seven in ten callers to Phillly311 were looking for basic or general information. On average, 19 percent<br />
needed to be transferred to another department or line, a rate that Philly311 likes to keep low. Another 9 percent were asking<br />
for a service, requiring an agent to submit a formal request to another city department.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Over seventy percent</strong> of calls on average to the Philly311 center were to ask a question, not to report an issue.</p>
<p>Assuming that this experience is similar to 311 operations in other municipalities, the biggest benefits of automation and innovation derived from a 311 API lie in addressing requests for information, not submitting service requests.</p>
<p>To this point, there is a nascent standard for querying data about government services and information &#8211; the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v1">311 Inquiry API</a>.</p>
<p>This developing standard was put forward by officials in New York City, who developed the first iteration of the specification.  There is a new version <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v2_Draft">currently in draft form</a>.</p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>The further development of a 311 Inquiry API and innovation built around it will be hugely important for municipalities running 311 contact centers, and even some that don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There is a very real, mesurable cost associated with calls to 311 contact centers.  The Pew report mentioned above reviewed the budget allocations and call volumes of 15 large U.S. cities that run 311 centers.  It estimates the average cost per call to 311 centers over these 15 cities at $3.39 per call.</p>
<p>If self-service applications and utilities can be built on top of a 311 Inquiry API then it may be possible to drive down the volume of telephone calls to 311 contact centers.  But even without a huge reduction in the number of calls, new self-service apps built on a 311 Inquiry API can lead to a better allocation of existing municipal resources. </p>
<p>There are inevitably people that will need to call a 311 center for information that are not able to self serve &#8211; either because of a lack of access to web or mobile apps for self service, or because of some other barrier (e.g., language).</p>
<p>These individuals are most appropriately handled by contact center agents, while other individuals &#8211; those with access to the web or mobile apps &#8211; are more appropriate for self service.  This will ensure that the most expensive and valuable resources in a 311 contact center &#8211; i.e., agents &#8211; are allocated to those citizens who most need more intensive, hands-on help.</p>
<p>Contact center managers certainly don&#8217;t want agents answering inquiries from people who are able to self serve, or who are more easily able to obtain needed information from another source.  This ties up an expensive, finite resource within a contact center with an individual who has other options in how they get their information.</p>
<p>I applaud the good folks at <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a> for all of the hard work they have done, and are doing, to encourage innovation in 311 services. If you havent <a href="http://open311.org/2012/01/an-open311-wish-list/">read Phil&#8217;s Open311 wish list</a> I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>On my own personal 311 wish list for 2012 is one thing &#8211; the further development and use of a 311 Inquiry API.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed that we&#8217;ll see more on this front in the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of smart people asking tough questions about civic hacking and hackathons as the new year begins &#8211; a new year that promises to see lots of action on the civic hacking front.</p>
<p>I think this is a good thing. The more we examine how civic hackathons work and the more we evaluate what they produce, the better we&#8217;ll get at running them and the more we&#8217;ll all get out of them.</p>
<p>A lot happened in the world of civic hacking, open data and hackathons in 2011.  But does all of this activity matter?  Are the events and activities we are seeing in the civic hacking space making a lasting difference?  Is the civic hackathon a construct that we will see used in the long run to promote new ideas and lasting civic change?</p>
<p>In a word, yes. Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-27"></span></p>
<h3>Confessions of a Civic Hacker</h3>
<p>First, a bit of a disclaimer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not objective on the subject of civic hackathons.  I was a competitor in the very first <a href="http://www.appsfordemocracy.org/">Apps for Democracy</a> that took place under Vivek Kundra in Washington, DC, and I was also a competitor in the first <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica/">Apps for America contest</a> put on by the Sunlight Foundation.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_55" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" data-attachment-id="55" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/apps-for-septa/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg" data-orig-size="488,329" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Civic Hacking" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=488" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=1000" alt="Apps for SEPTA" title="Apps for SEPTA"   class="size-full wp-image-55" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg 488w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/apps-for-septa.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px" /><p id="caption-attachment-55" class="wp-caption-text">Apps for SEPTA in Philadelphia</p></div>
<p>Since then, I’ve been a participant in lots of other civic hackathons and coding events as either a participant, organizer or sponsor (sometimes as more than one).</p>
<p>In March, I&#8217;ll be speaking at <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive</a> on the subject of civic hackathons, describing lessons learned at hackathons in 2011 and highlighting strategies for holding successful events in 2012 and beyond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written before about the <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/08/open-government-hackathons-matter/">value of hackathons</a>, and tried to dispel what I consider to be <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2307">misconceptions about them</a>, or highlight what I believe is unreasonable in terms of <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1850">expectations for their success</a>.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I think I&#8217;m also a realist about what it takes to deliver real civic change.  I&#8217;ve worked in government before and I understand the challenges and priorities of those in the public sector.  I think a critical evaluation of civic hacking is healthy, and this is a very good time to do it.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to examine the value of civic hacking in general and hackathons in particular, I think looking back on what happened in 2011 is critical.  A lot of very important things in the world of civic hacking took place last year.</p>
<h3>What I saw in 2011</h3>
<p>One of the most important trends I saw last year was the growth in independently organized civic hacking events.  These events were not organized by the local government that was the &#8220;subject&#8221; of the hackathon, and they lacked the large cash prizes of the more traditional municipal hacking event.</p>
<p>These events are different than <a href="http://2011.nycbigapps.com/">NYC Big Apps</a> or <a href="http://www.appsformetrochicago.com/">Apps for Metro Chicago</a> (although those events are pretty cool too).</p>
<p>I wrote about events in <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/29/opengov-year-in-review-philly-edition/">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="https://civic.io/2011/12/30/opengov-year-in-review-baltimore-edition/">Baltimore</a> that I helped organize in earlier posts.  Other locally-organized events took place in <a href="http://hack4reno.com/">Reno, NV </a>and in <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">San Francisco</a>.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMnoJFQb2xI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>These events are important because they are driven by civic activists and hackers that want to make their own cities work better and smarter.  This wasn&#8217;t hackathons foisted onto the local technology community by some well meaning but ill informed elected official or government employee.</p>
<p>This was local hacker communities deciding that they wanted to work on issues that affect their neighborhoods and their cities, and choosing the hackathon as the vehicle to most effectively do it.  That&#8217;s a big deal in my mind.</p>
<p>These events were highly focused on specific problems.  An event in Philadelphia was focused on transit issues; an event in Baltimore focused on education; the series of &#8220;Summer of Smart&#8221; events in San Francisco each focused on a single issue like food and nutrition to health to sustainable energy usage.</p>
<p>Some of these events had unique follow through as well &#8211; circling back to government officials with the outcome of the civic hacking events, highlighting innovative solutions to the people that hold elected or appointed office.</p>
<p>in Philadelphia, an entire day was spent <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/21/septa-developer-showcase-puts-realtime-schedule-apps-on-display-for-transit-agency-officials">showcasing the solutions built by outside developers</a> to the management of the regional transit authority.  In San Francisco, the solutions developed during the Summer of Smart hackathons were <a href="http://www.summerofsmart.org/events/summer-of-smart-final-mayoral-forum/">presented to the entire slate of candidates running for mayor</a>.</p>
<p>Not only were hackathons independently organized in 2011, in some cases so were the open data repositories for cities.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">the open data</a> site was built and is managed by a private firm &#8211; <a href="http://www.azavea.com/">Azavea</a> &#8211; and the city&#8217;s open data efforts operate under <a href="http://www.openaccessphilly.com/">the stewardship of a group</a> comprised of representatives from the public, private, non-profit and education sectors.</p>
<p>In Chattanooga, TN a <a href="http://openchattanooga.com/">similar approach is developing</a> &#8211; built using the same software platform that was open sourced by the OpenAccessPhilly group in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>All of these events, to one degree or another, helped to galvanize the local technology community in these cities and demonstrate that building software-based solutions with open government data (or helping to liberate such data from outdated government websites) is a highly valuable form of civic engagement.  </p>
<p>This is helping to develop and fortify the civic hacking culture in these cities.  Consider the example of <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/10/05/next-septa-developer-reed-lauber-launches-subway-bus-and-trolley-schedule-app">Reed Lauber of Philadelphia</a>, developer of <a href="http://nextsepta.com/">NextSEPTA</a> (a mobile web app for transit riders):</p>
<blockquote><p>
“Like so many urban developers, I just want to provide resources that make my fellow citizens’ lives a little easier,” he said. “Really, I made it for myself and hope that someone else out there will also find it useful.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or consider the example of Mike Subelsky in Baltimore, the driving force behind an intricate project to combine and refine data on <a href="http://www.subelsky.com/2011/12/who-owns-vacant-properties-in-baltimore.html">property ownership in Baltimore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;m looking for awesome ideas for my next startup. I&#8217;m hoping that by solving your problem I&#8217;ll learn enough about your industry/your life that I&#8217;ll stumble onto something that a lot of other people also need, something I could build a business around. You can only get good ideas by working on real problems.
</p></blockquote>
<p>With all of that being said, we are still learning how to run civic hackathons successfully. We will continue to need good ideas and experimentation to help ensure sustainability of the developed projects, and to close the feedback loop with public officials and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>We still have work to do.</p>
<h3>Toward More Sustainable Civic Hacking</h3>
<p>As big a success as 2011 was for civic hacking, 2012 needs to be even bigger.</p>
<p>Will it be the year that civic hackathons move, once and for all, away from large one time cash prizes and towards rewarding winners with the chance to &#8220;live the dream&#8221; and make their weekend project into a viable business?</p>
<p>Will it be the year that more governments step up for real and actively market and promote civic apps built with their open data and APIs?</p>
<p>Will it be the year where we see widespread adoption of common standards across governments that will make it easier and more efficient to build solutions that can be used by multiple governments?</p>
<p>I hope so&#8230;</p>
