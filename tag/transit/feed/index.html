										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve spent any time on a subway platform or at a bus stop lately, you may have witnessed one of the great success stories of open government data.</p>
<p>All of those people checking the arrival and departure times of trains, trolleys and buses are consuming applications built with open transit data.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;margin:10px;padding:5px;" title="Open data has fundamentally changed how we use transit" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/transit.jpg?w=254&#038;h=203" alt="transit" width="254" height="203" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great example of how open data has changed (and continues to change) the way we use public transit, and the role of transit agencies in developing consumer-facing applications.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://policybythenumbers.blogspot.com/2012/01/transit-transparency-open-data-in.html">really interesting post</a> over on the Google &#8220;Policy by the Numbers&#8221; blog that examines some of the reasons that open transit data has had such a dramatic impact in places where it has been embraced (h/t to O&#8217;Reilly Media&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/digiphile">Alex Howard</a> for the link).</p>
<p><span id="more-191"></span></p>
<p>The post is by Francisca Rojas, research director at the Harvard Kennedy Schoolâ€™s <a href="http://transparencypolicy.net/">Transparency Policy Project</a>. It describes how open data has fostered the development of a new way of thinking about service delivery &#8211; both inside and outside of government agencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>In just a few years, a rich community has developed around [transit] data, with visionary champions for disclosure inside transit agencies collaborating with eager software developers to deliver multiple ways for riders to access real-time information about transit.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some really important lessons that can be drawn from the example of transit data, that open data supporters can use in other areas to encourage both the release of open data and it&#8217;s effective use.</p>
<p>First, open data needs a champion within the agency or organization to evangelize the benefits of releasing such data. In the absence of such a champion, developing a process around the release of open data, and sustaining and growing this process over time, can be a challenge.</p>
<p>If you look at transit agencies that understand the benefits of open data, you will invariably find a visionary thinker inside that agency that does the yeoman&#8217;s work of converting people to the cause. This isn&#8217;t meant to suggest that transit agency employees (or other government employees for that matter) are hostile or resistant to open data &#8211; it&#8217;s just a different way of thinking about the role of government or transit agencies. A visionary thinker on the inside can dramatically improve the chances of success for an open data program.</p>
<p>A good example of such a thinker is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelzaleski">Mike Zaleski</a> &#8211; Director of Emerging and Specialty Technology at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (<a href="http://www.septa.org/">SEPTA</a>). Mike is a true open government leader, and has done great work in advancing the way that SEPTA thinks about open data and transit APIs.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things I&#8217;ve witnessed at SEPTA that has resulted from Mike&#8217;s efforts is a <a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/21/septa-developer-showcase-puts-realtime-schedule-apps-on-display-for-transit-agency-officials">change in the culture</a> &#8211; my perception is that people are starting to think differently about SEPTA&#8217;s role in delivering information.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p>Another important factor in the success of open data efforts is the relationship cultivated by the agency with outside software developers. As Rojas states in her post on the Google Policy by the Numbers blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we have seen in our study of transit transparency is that local programmers have been the critical intermediaries, taking raw data and generating a variety of information tools that transit agencies could not have imagined on their own. For other open government initiatives to spark this level of innovation and public benefit, they must identify their audience of information intermediaries and foster those relationships.</p></blockquote>
<p>This means that simply releasing data &#8211; standing up an open data portal and filling it with data sets &#8211; is not enough. Governments must reach out to developers and cultivate relationships with them. Developers play a critical role in helping <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/10/do-hackathons-and-civic-hacking-matter/">stretch the traditional notions</a> of what public service delivery is and can be.</p>
<p>Successful open data efforts are built around a community of developers and include strategies for building and nurturing relationships with developers. This development community can be seen as the external &#8220;champion&#8221; of open data &#8211; helping agencies understand how that most important ingredient (ata) can be applied in new and creative ways to help their communities.</p>
<p>Open data needs champions &#8211; inside and outside of government. Those of us pushing for more open government data need to help identify these champions, and celebrate their good work when we do.</p>
<p>Rock on, champions. Rock on!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is the third in a series about building an open source transit data application using <acronym title="General Transit Feed Specification">GTFS</acronym> data from the <a href="http://www.dartfirststate.com/" target="_blank">Delaware Transit Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2073">the first post</a>, I described how to download the State of Delaware&#8217;s transit data and populate a MySQL database with it.  </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2117">the previous post</a>, I walked through a process of setting up stored procedures for querying the transit data and setting up a LAMP application environment.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to write code for our transit app!</p>
<h3>Choosing a Platform</h3>
<p>One of the most under appreciated developments that has accompanied the increasing amount of government data that has become available in open formats is the vast array of new tools now available for developers to use.  I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1471">talked about this a lot</a> in the past but it bears repeating &#8211; it has never been easier to build sophisticated, multi-channel communication applications than it is now.<br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/tropo_logo.png" alt="Tropo" title="Tropo" style="margin:10px;padding:15px;float:right;" /><br />
The number of options open to developers is truly exciting, but there are some platforms that rise above the rest in terms of ease of use and in what they enable developers to do.  For this project, I will use the <a href="https://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/newhowitworks.htm" target="_blank">Tropo WebAPI platform</a>.</p>
<p>The Tropo WebAPI has a number of advantage that will come in handy for our transit app project (and any other projects you&#8217;ve got in the works).  You can write a Tropo app in one of several popular scripting and web development languages &#8211; Ruby, Python, PHP, C# and JavaScript (Node.js).  There are <a href="https://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/libraries.htm" target="_blank">libraries available for each language</a> that make it easy to build Tropo apps and to integrate with the Tropo API.  (Disclaimer &#8211; I&#8217;ve worked on several of these libraries.)</p>
<p>In addition, the real magic that Tropo brings to the table is the ability to serve users on multiple communication channels (phone, IM, SMS, Twitter) from a single code base.  This is especially important for an application meant to service transit riders.  These users may not have the luxury of sitting in front of a desktop computer in order to look up information on a bus route or schedule.  They are much more likely to be traveling and using some sort of phone or mobile device.  The Tropo WebAPI is perfect for our needs.</p>
<p>Vivek Kundra, the former CIO of the District of Columbia and current CIO of the United States, has described the effort by governments to release data in open formats as &#8220;the democratization of data&#8221; &#8211; these efforts make previously hard to get, or hard to use data available for everyone.</p>
<p>I like to describe platforms like <a href="https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp" target="_blank">Tropo</a> and the various libraries that are available to use with it as &#8220;the democratization of application development&#8221; &#8211; these tools make building powerful communication apps simple for anyone who understands web development.</p>
<h3>Building our Transit App</h3>
<p>Before we can build our application, we need to decide what it will do.</p>
<p>For our purposes, this has already been determined by the stored procedures we built <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2117">in the last post</a>.  Our <strong>transitdata</strong> database has 2 stored procedures &#8211; one to return the nearest bus stops to a specific address or location, and one to return the next bus departure times from a specific bus stop.</p>
<p>However, this series of posts is meant to inspire readers to build their own applications &#8211; now that you have transit data in a powerful relational database like MySQL you can query it any way you like.  In addition, the SQL scripts and steps developed for this series of posts can certainly be used with the data from any other transit agency that uses the GTFS format.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds">There are lots</a>.  Use your imagination &#8211; build whatever you find useful.</p>
<p>So now that we have some idea of what we want our application to do, we need to select a development language.  It will probably come as no surprise that for this example I&#8217;m going to use the <a href="http://php.net/" target="_blank">PHP scripting language</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-php" target="_blank">PHP Library for the Tropo WebAPI</a>.  PHP is a good match for Linux, Apache and MySQL &#8211; all technologies we used in the previous entries in this series of blog posts.</p>
<p>If you want some more detailed information on building PHP applications that run on the Tropo WebAPI platform, you can review a separate series of blog posts on this issue <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1918">here</a>.</p>
<p>To get the <a href="http://github.com/tropo/tropo-webapi-php" target="_blank">PHP Library for the Tropo WebAPI</a>, you can download it and unpack on your web server, or simply clone the Github repo.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you can grab the code for our demo application from <a href="http://gist.github.com/659768" target="_blank">GitHub as well</a>.</p>
<p>In order to test this application, you&#8217;ll need to sign up for a free Tropo account &#8211; you can <a href="https://www.tropo.com/" target="_blank">do that here</a>.  Once you are signed up, go to the Applications section in your Tropo account and set up a new WebAPI application that points to the location of our PHP script on your web server.  You can see more detailed information on setting up a Tropo account <a href="https://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/newquickstart.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/web-api.png" alt="web-api" title="web-api" width="412" height="240" /></p>
<p>Note &#8211; You&#8217;ll also need an API key from Google Maps for geocoding addresses &#8211; <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html" target="_blank">get one here</a>.  Change the following line in the application to include your Google API key:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
define("MAPS_API_KEY", "your-api-key-goes-here");
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Once your Tropo account and application are set up, you can add as many different contact methods as you like &#8211; your Tropo application is automatically provisioned a Skype number, a SIP number and an iNUM.  </p>
<p>To illustrate how our transit app will work, I&#8217;ve gone ahead and assigned a Jabber IM name to my app &#8211; <strong>findthebus@tropo.im</strong>.  Add this to your friends/user list in Google chat and you can use the app I&#8217;ve set up.  Here&#8217;s what it looks like in my IM client:</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/transit-finder1.png" alt="transit-finder1" title="transit-finder1" /></p>
<p>As you can see, my first IM to <strong>findthebus@tropo.im</strong> sends the address of a building in Downtown Wilmington (actually, a building I used to work in).  The app responds with the three closest bus stops and the distance (in miles) to each.</p>
<p>I then send the number of the bus stop I am interested in.  The app responds with the next three buses to leave that stop, the route served by each and the number of minutes before each departs.</p>
<p>How cools is that!</p>
<p>I could very easily make this application more sophisticated, so that it it delivers content tailored to specific channels (i.e., IM vs. phone) but I want to keep things simple for now.</p>
<p>In the next blog post of this series, we will introduce some additional tools, including Google Maps and the new hotness in cloud telephony &#8211; <a href="http://phono.com/" target="_blank">Phono</a>.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

Democratizing government data will help change how government operatesâ€”and give citizens the ability to participate in making government services more effective, accessible, and transparent.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Democratizing-Data/" target="_blank">Peter Orszag</a>, OMB Director
</p></blockquote>
<p>This post is a continuation in a series on building a transit data application using <a href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">GTFS</a> data recently released by the State of Delaware.</p>
<p>If you missed my first post, <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2073">go back and check it out</a>.  You can get a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database loaded up with all of the Delaware GTFS data in just a couple of minutes.  Once you do that, you&#8217;ll be ready to follow along.<br />
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/mysql.png" alt="MySQL Database" title="MySQL Database" style="float:right;padding:10px;margin:10px;" /><br />
Continuing our work from the last post, in this post we&#8217;ll finish building out our database and set up an environment to run a web application &#8211; for the purposes of the demo app I&#8217;m building for this series, I&#8217;ll assume you have a standard <acronym title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</acronym> set up to work with.</p>
<h3>Finish the Database Setup</h3>
<p>In the last post, we downloaded the GTFS data from the State of Delaware, unzipped it and loaded it into a MySQL database.  Now, we need to set up some stored procedures so that we can extract data from our MySQL database and present it to an end user.</p>
<p>You can see the stored procedures I created for this demo application <a href="http://gist.github.com/632306">on GitHub</a>.  To load them into our shiny new database, simply run:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>  ~$ wget http://gist.github.com/raw/632306/
	    9860651ba2a61cd5af1c18529cdbab5f8c6f8e97/dartfirststate_de_us_procs.sql </pre>
<pre>  ~$ mysql -u user_name -p transitdata &lt; dartfirststate_de_us_procs.sql</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Thats it!</p>
<p>If you look at these procedures, you&#8217;ll see that they are set up to answer two different questions from users.  The first one &#8211; <code>getDepartureTimesAndRoutesByStopID</code> &#8211; will query our database and get a set of routes and departure times by the ID of a transit stop.  The other &#8211; <code>GetClosestStopsByLocation</code> &#8211;  accepts a lat/lon and returns the stop ID and name of the transit stops closest the the requesting location.</p>
<p>In practice, you can see these two procedures working in tandem &#8211; the later procedure would be used by someone wishing to find the transit stop closest to their present location.  The former would provide information on the next buses to reach that stop, the routes they serve and the scheduled departure time from that location.</p>
<p>There are certainly many more potential queries that could be used to extract valuable information from the GTFS data in our database, but these two should suffice for our demo application.  Also, both are pretty well suited for use from a text messaging (<acronym title="Short Message Service">SMS</acronym>) application, which is what we&#8217;ll build in the last post in this series.</p>
<h3>Setting up the Application Environment</h3>
<p>I assume for this series of posts that you have access to a LAMP server.  This server should be hosted somewhere where it can receive HTTP posts from a third party platform (this is required in order to build an SMS application).</p>
<p>While it is not a requirement that you code your transit application in PHP, I will do so in this series.  Feel free to use the development language of your choice in building your own application &#8211; just about every web development language can work with MySQL.</p>
<p>Before we start writing code, lets finish a few last items.  First, lets create a user for our web application &#8211; remember to give this user only the privileges they need.  For our demo application, the web app user only needs to <code>EXECUTE</code> stored procedures.  So, we want to do this at the MySQL shell:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; GRANT EXECUTE ON transitdata.* TO username@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; </pre>
<pre>mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Be sure to replace the &#8216;username&#8217; and &#8216;password&#8217; above with values of your choosing.  Now, let&#8217;s put our database access credentials in a safe and convenient place.</p>
<p>When writing a web application, I prefer not to store this inforamtion in my code (as a config item or declared constant).  Instead, I like to keep this information in my Apache configuration.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Apache on Ubuntu, you can typically just store this inforamtion in your VirtualHost file (located in <code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</code>).  Use the Apache <strong>SetEnv</strong> directive to set the values you want to store:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
SetEnv TRANSIT_DB_HOST localhost
SetEnv TRANSIT_DB_USER username
SetEnv TRANSIT_DB_PASS password
SetEnv TRANSIT_DB_NAME transitdata
SetEnv TRANSIT_DB_PORT 3306
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Again,  be sure to replace the â€˜usernameâ€™ and â€˜passwordâ€™ above with the values used when creating your MySQL user.  Once you have entered these values into your VirtualHost file, save it and reload Apache:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre> ~$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we&#8217;re all set to start writing code! </p>
<p>In the next post we&#8217;ll build a simple, yet powerful PHP-based SMS application that anyone with a cell phone can use to find a transit location nearest to them in the State of Delaware, and find out the departure times / routes from that location.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
