					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for raising this topic again Mark. In Europe, there is some momentum behind the Open and Agile Smart Cities initiative which is trying to create a kind of organic, bottom-up type model that starts with a civic tech prototype being built in one city, then it is prototyped in a second city, with the aim of seeing what is the minimum core data model that would be necessary to scale it across different jurisdictions. (I wrote about it here: https://neurope.eu/article/addressing-the-fragmentation-of-the-smart-cities-market/). The UK Future Catapult and British Standards Institute are also working on a civic standards framework: http://futurecities.catapult.org.uk/project/cities-standards-institute/

And while i try to keep up with your writing, i only came across this post while researching whether Open311 is still a thing. Open311.org doesn&#039;t show much sign of current life (although there was a teleconference in March evidently), although cities around the world are still adopting the standard: Pittsburgh has recently put through a Council proposal to adopt the standard, and Lewisham in the UK just adopted it: https://www.mysociety.org/2016/02/15/lewisham-council-switches-to-open311/).

I&#039;m kind of hopeful that APIs will help resolve this in a practical sense. With open data portals increasingly enabling the data they host to also be consumed in an API format (Socrata, OpenDataSoft and Junar all do this i believe), then the API means that data is at least available in a standardized (consumable) format. I&#039;m hopeful we will then see civic tech create abstraction layers that mean different open data sources could be consumed in the same way. A bit like how Segment.io and SumAll consume a range of social media APIs and match up the different ways each social media data source configures time or describes a location so that you can create a realtime dashboard across the range of sources. Orchestrate.io do that for databases: funnelling data from multiple databases into the one API. So if open data portals all publish the data sources so that they can be consumed as an API, an application maker could scale across different jurisdictions by consuming each data source via API. From talking with providers like SumAll, that is still a lot of work, though. This is a bit like what @tmcw is saying above, i think. There is still a lot of parsing involved in this, but a lot less than if dealing directly with open data sources in a wider variety of formats, i believe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark - We met at Urban.us conference last year &#038; this is reply to &quot;Who Uses Civic Tech&quot;. 

We&#039;ve had quite a journey and it took a side project (Cards Against Urbanity) to show us (1) how to engage and (2) civic tech to what end?  Reporting a pothole outside your house has an obvious connection, but why one should care about affordable housing, transit routing, the budget process, a new comprehensive plan.... 

We pivoted to tech + games. This Governing article is a good summary. http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-cards-against-urbanity.html   Bottom line - (1) Reliance on the public meeting + powerpoint kills communications and (2) basic knowledge on what programs are and how they work essential  

Just launched the new product referenced in the Governing article - City Design Method Cards. It&#039;s basically Cards FOR Urbanity - we are testing a theory that civic tech needs its own &quot;platform for great cities&quot; to inspire people before they can fully (and happily) engage on the big stuff.  
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910898498/city-design-method-cards

Hope this helps. We are still watching how the allocation of resources is playing out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David - I was involved in a project like that before. There is a good write up of our efforts &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2011/08/24/philly-snap-hackathon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Worth noting that though we were able to get support for some outreach and to raise awareness, we ran up against a wall when we asked the city to help spread the word of its availability.

This makes me think that it might be worth exploring whether the problem is how we&#039;re building civic apps, or how we&#039;re marketing them.  I wonder if anyone has considered that and looked into it more deeply.

Eric - I share your concern as well. I&#039;m now living in a place that - population wise - is much similar to where you are. I too worry about whether or not we are listening closely enough to the challenges facing these areas as well as the big cities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David Shaeffer&#039;s comment echoes one of my thoughts. Much of civic tech is driven by technologists who over-focus on the product itself and neglect all the other parts of the process. Even when civic tech is volunteer-driven and free, we need to think about marketing and ongoing communication with users (as well as how we maintain the product going forward). Another question that arose for me re-reading the study just now is the extent to which sites (esp in the US) are optimized or not for use on mobile. Aside from a few comments, that data wasn&#039;t provided in the discussion, but may be relevant to under-representation of younger people and non-whites in the US.

Finally, one of the things that worries me generally in civic tech is the danger of leaving behind all of the smaller places, not only rural towns and counties, but also smaller suburbs in urban areas. In my area, for example, &quot;Asheville&quot; has an area population of over 300K, but only 80K are in the city itself - the majority live in other jurisdictions, all of them with much smaller populations. And of course folks living in the surrounding, mostly rural counties are even worse off. Civic tech is these places hard to measure because we can&#039;t get big enough samples of users from them, and they&#039;re underrepresented in civic tech generally because they lack the resources, local developer communities, etc. I see figuring out ways to bring them along and to understand the particular issues they face as one of the important challenges we need to be looking at.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this when I first read it in October and now again -- thanks, Mark. When I think of civic tech and who uses it, I keep coming back to issues of education, marketing, and organizing. 

Specifically with the WH&#039;s recent Opportunity program, I wonder what efforts will be made to get these new solutions in front of the people that need them most (marginalized and underserved).  Do you know if there are plans in place to evangelize these solutions? Are there any good examples of a civic tech solution built for the marginalized and underserved that dedicated resources to education and evangelization?  

To me that step in the process -- getting the solution to the people that need it most -- is lacking, but I&#039;d love to be proven wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the &quot;killer app&quot; of open data?  Does it need one? Does Open Data need a &quot;VisiCalc&quot; - the app that turned the Apple II from a hobbyist kit to a business necessity?

GTFS, it can be argued, was the VisiCalc of public transit - but then again, even though we all benefit from it, its primary users and direct consumers are only a handful of specialized organizations.

Do we need a &quot;killer app&quot; for each segment - one for policy-makers (something to help them understand budgets perhaps?), one for citizens (a more robust, performant CityGram on steroids maybe?), and one for businesses (market research, real estate dashboards, etc.)

What about the fact that a lot of incumbent information brokers&#039; business models rely on data being hard to get?  Do we just make it easier for them to consume the data, and hopefully spawn a whole host of govtech/civictech startups to disrupt the incumbents and democratize access to data?

If you look at the &quot;standards&quot; that made the Web successful, one notices that they were unencumbered, and more importantly, easy to implement.  This allowed for experimentation without permission.   Easy enough, so a young college kid halfway around the world cut-and-paste a website, replete with animated Java applets, that brought down a Sun SPARC server in the US (me - in my early days of experimentation).

And speaking of the Web, TBL&#039;s vision of the Semantic Web is enthralling.  But who&#039;s going to do all that markup so we can have the web of linked open data, readily cross-walking disparate seeming unrelated datasets?

To me, open data is a process.  A data portal does not an open data program make.  And as you pointed out, each jurisdiction has its own process, and appropriately so.

And maybe, that&#039;s why &quot;de facto&quot; standards is the main way to go - implement something that works with an easily demonstrable public benefit FIRST, as was the case with GTFS. Or another de facto standard - schema.org, as publishers want to be found in Google&#039;s web.

Of course, there&#039;s also a way unique to government to enforce standards - the force of law, as is the case with XBRL.]]></description>
