<h1 id="6b0a">Hey there!</h1>



<p id="1f02">Are you thinking of joining the federal government to build better digital services for those that need them? Are you new to government service?</p>



<p id="0226">Awesome! This post is for you.</p>



<span id="more-4808"></span>



<p id="bfe8">You may not have an especially positive view of government technology. You may have heard about all the bureaucracy. Lots of waterfall. Lots of big design and requirements gathering up front. Big, complex, infrequent, risky deployments. Government has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/highrisk/overview">all of these</a>!</p>



<p id="6940">You may think that government&nbsp;IT shops need to learn more about agile, and DevOps, iterative delivery, and generally more about the way that product teams deliver stuff in the private sector. And you’d be right — we do need more of that.</p>



<p id="6843">But what you may not know, and what may take you a while to figure out, is that a lot of the things that make delivering digital services in government more difficult exist for a reason. There is a constituency for the madness we see in government IT — someone whose objectives and goals are served by the labyrinth processes and rules we must navigate in order to ship something.</p>



<h1 id="9f9c">The Year of COBOL</h1>



<p id="72e9">If you were reading or watching the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/">news about state Unemployment Insurance systems melting down</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, you probably heard the word COBOL.</p>



<p id="f521"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>&nbsp;is a programming language that was created decades ago to run on mainframe computer systems and is still in use today, most especially in government. You may even encounter it after you start your journey in public service. In some ways, COBOL and its continued use by states and the federal government became a convenient scapegoat for the problems that public benefit systems experienced this year. But the truth was deeper than that.</p>



<p id="8ed2">One of my favorite write ups on COBOL this year is from the technology historian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iit.edu/directory/people/mar-hicks">Mar Hicks</a>, who&nbsp;<a href="https://logicmag.io/care/built-to-last/">details how COBOL was developed and became widely used</a>&nbsp;in both government and the private sector. A point in this essay that resonated strongly with me is that one of the reasons that COBOL is so often disparaged in the world of “modern technology” is because of the characteristics of the language that were meant to make it easy to use:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>But despite this, there’s a cottage industry devoted to making fun of COBOL precisely for its strengths. COBOL’s qualities of being relatively self-documenting, having a short onboarding period (though a long path to becoming an expert), and having been originally designed by committee for big, unglamorous, infrastructural business systems all count against it.</p></blockquote>



<p id="df8d">So, the features of the COBOL language specifically designed as virtues have become the reason it is so often scorned.</p>



<p id="44ab">There is a parallel here that we can draw with government — the features of government designed specifically to be virtuous (and which, as a result, can introduce complexity and bureaucracy) are the reason it is so often scored.</p>



<h1 id="6e99">Complex by Design</h1>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To overcome bureaucracy, we need to separate those of its aspects that are problematic from those that are not, and focus our efforts on the former.</p><p>— Mark Schwartz,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Delicate_Art_of_Bureaucracy/qUXcDwAAQBAJ">Author</a>&nbsp;and former CTO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</a></p></blockquote>



<p id="c319">Governments don’t use waterfall because they like it (spoiler: they don’t). They don’t do massive up front requirements gathering, sometimes taking years before a single user is talked to or line of code is written, because it results in better outcomes (spoiler: it doesn’t).</p>



<p id="87fd">They do these things because the budgetary, regulatory and oversight environment in which government IT operates&nbsp;<em>favors</em>&nbsp;these methods. It rewards projects that use them with approvals, and funding, and ATOs.</p>



<p id="e69b">And the fact that people in government might use these methods isn’t as irrational as it might first seem.</p>



<p id="8eec">Governments are complex because they are big and have lots of responsibilities, but they are also complex on purpose. The complexity is baked in as a way to guard against things like corruption and the concentration of power. Oversight and auditing powers are vested in different parts of the government, and they all have a legitimate and important role in how services get delivered.</p>



<p id="8bf3">Our government was&nbsp;<a href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-51/">designed to make it harder to do things quickly</a>&nbsp;and effectively. That notion is as American as apple pie. And while this isn’t always the reason that government technology projects fail, it is a common reason why a project team might adopt suboptimal practices.</p>



<p id="a708">Someone else in the government enterprise has a need or objective that is served by the requirements imposed on technology projects. And those requirements incentivize the things we preach against in pursuit of successful outcomes. It’s not an information deficit on good practices that leads project teams to do things the wrong way, but rather&nbsp;<a href="https://mheadd.medium.com/filling-up-the-civic-tech-toolbox-a976161a84be">a rational response</a>&nbsp;to bureaucratic pressures they are facing.</p>



<p id="1f7a">“Reforming” the way we do government technology, or scaling good practices across agencies will require us to understand the nature of these incentives, why they exist, whose purposes they serve, and how they push project teams to adopt bad practices.</p>



<p id="442d">We need more people in government who understand the practices that help ensure successful delivery of government digital services. We also need more people in government who understand the constraints and incentives facing agencies who want to adopt them.</p>



<p id="1e7a">We need you.</p>

<p>It’s sort of a cliche to say it these days, but digital transformation in government is <a href="https://medium.com/@mheadd/process-eats-culture-for-breakfast-e5da02b2128e">largely not about technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems like this is an idea that has broad consensus, but much of the work that gets done in and around government technology modernization still views problems solely through the lens of technology. What if we approached this work differently? What if we viewed the problems of government technology through the lens of other disciplines?&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-4798"></span>



<p>We don’t need to pretend we’re always experts in these other disciplines &#8211; we’re not going to convince our partners that we’re doctors or economists, because we are not. But it is often useful to look at the problems facing governments in implementing and managing digital solutions using the analytic tools and frameworks of non-technology disciplines.</p>



<p>The following is not an exhaustive list of ideas for doing this, and I may not be saying anything all that revolutionary here. But this is a summary of a few of the ideas for doing this I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Symptoms vs. cause</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy to spot bad technology &#8211; we often just point our browsers at a government website and our minds immediately begin to coalesce around solutions. We think we understand the problems and we move quickly &#8211; often too quickly &#8211; to find the answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s helpful sometimes to think of a government technology problem as a sick patient &#8211; one we must diagnose in order to prescribe a cure. The analytic frameworks of medicine accommodate the idea that what we see with our eyes or touch with our hands may not actually be the problem. Physicians work to identify the underlying cause of a malady and treat it, rather than simply addressing the symptoms that manifest for our eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so it is with government technology problems. Distinguishing between the symptoms and the cause is important. A broken website or failed system implementation are often the symptoms of larger, more fundamental problems. They are the symptoms, and if we simply treat them, the underlying malady will linger. And while there are plenty of other approaches in IT consulting that can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">help with root cause analysis</a>, I find it really helpful to think about the approach of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis#Differential_diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a>.</p>



<p>What are all of the possible things that could be causing the symptoms that we are seeing with our eyes? Which one of them (or which combination) makes the most sense in explaining what we are seeing, and which do not? This approach not only focuses on underlying causes, it inherently implies that there may be more than one cause for a problem &#8211; something that is often true when we work on government technology projects that have run into problems.</p>



<p><strong>Assuming rationality</strong></p>



<p>So much of the work we do in government technology modernization involves developing advice &#8211; lists of best practices, and guides to help agencies adopt technology more successfully. “Here is how agile works, here is why DevSecOps is so important, talk to users, scope projects smaller &#8211; now go do these things.” *</p>



<p>And while all of this guidance and content is valuable, this approach assumes that the sole problem facing development and service delivery teams is a lack of information. But what if we proceeded from the assumption that an information deficit was not the primary cause of technology dysfunction in a government agency, that delivery teams had access to information on how to properly run their projects but chose not to anyway? What would explain these decisions if lack of access to information on how to do it properly was not the issue?</p>



<p>It’s useful in these cases, I think, to look at an idea from the world of economics &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">rational choice theory</a>. This theory holds that individual actors in a market will act rationally and in their own self interest based on available information. I’m not suggesting that this theory explains everything about how markets work (it doesn’t), but it is a useful construct in helping us understand why service delivery teams &#8211; and government agencies more broadly &#8211; make the choices that they make. If we approach a technology problem using the assumption that the individuals making decisions will act rationally, then it helps us to focus on the reasons these choices get made.</p>



<p>Consider the directive to scope technology projects more modestly, and to iterate frequently. There is plenty of information and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects">accumulated experience</a> to suggest that larger technology projects fail at a higher rate than smaller ones. If we assume that information deficit is not the root cause of decisions to scope projects bigger &#8211; i.e., project teams know that larger projects have increased risk of failure &#8211; then what explains the reasons that projects become large?</p>



<p>If we assume rationality, we might better understand the reasons why a service delivery team might choose a larger project over a smaller one. Consider the process to <a href="https://atos.open-control.org/steps/">accredit technology systems for production deployment</a> &#8211; this process usually involves a significant amount of paperwork and documentation on a litany of different security controls. It can sometimes cost a team more in terms of time and effort than the work to actually build a solution in the first place. Given the overhead involved in a process like this, it might make sense from a project team perspective to limit the need to run this gauntlet to as few times as possible &#8211; or even only once if that can be achieved. This might drive a team to enlarge a project scope, to reduce the number of iterations, and jam as much work into a release as possible so as to only pay the overhead of the accreditation process once.</p>



<p>Viewed in this way, we can see that the decision to scope a project more broadly is rational (from the perspective of the project team). It makes sense given the weight of the process that may be needed to get successive iterations of a solution released. It’s not that a project team isn’t aware of the risks of larger projects with fewer iterations, it’s that the environment in which they are building the solution favors larger projects. It “rewards” them with fewer trips through the accreditation labyrinth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a bit of a contrived example, but it’s not a stretch to apply this same line of reasoning to things like the procurement process (which can also be lengthy and costly) or other processes that have phase-gates with large documentation requirements at each step. Faced with the overhead of complying with these processes, it is rational to enlarge projects so as to pay this cost as few times as possible.<br></p>



<p>Understanding why delivery teams would make these decisions is key to understanding the root cause of technology dysfunction. The answer is often more expansive than just the technology being used.</p>



<p>We need to free our minds, to open up opportunities for thinking about problems differently. For this to work, we need to look at how other disciplines analyze problems and understand their causes. There’s so much room here to add to our standard tool kit for fixing government technology issues. As civic technologists, it’s up to us to find them and start using them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Let’s fill up our tool box.</p>



<p>* &nbsp;<em>Oversimplified to make a point, but you get my drift.</em></p>

<h3>How Poor Technology Choices Can Magnify the Challenges Faced by Those Seeing Government Services</h3>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For every 10 people who said they successfully filed for unemployment benefits during the previous four weeks three to four additional people tried to apply but could not get through the system to make a claim. Two additional people did not try to apply because it was too difficult to do so. When we extrapolate our survey findings to the full five weeks of UI claims since March 15, <strong>we estimate that an additional 8.9–13.9 million people could have filed for benefits had the process been easier</strong>. [Emphasis added]</p>
<p><cite><em>Unemployment filing failures: New survey confirms that millions of jobless were unable to file an unemployment insurance claim. </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/" target="_blank">Economic Policy Institute</a></cite></p>
<p></p></blockquote>


<p>The impact on jobs and our economy from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the attempts by our government to provide relief for those impacted through the CARES Act has brought into sharp focus the issue of <em>administrative burden</em>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.13134" target="_blank">Administrative burden</a> can be succinctly defined as “an individual’s experience of a policy’s implementation as onerous.”</p>



<span id="more-4789"></span>



<p>In the book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Administrative_Burden.html?id=CLB4DwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Administrative Burden: Policy Making by Other Means</em></a>, Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan define administrative burden as the aggregate <em>learning</em> cost, <em>compliance</em> cost, and <em>psychological</em> cost of meeting the requirements to access a government service or benefit. As we watch almost in real time as state benefit systems fail again and again from the increased demand for benefits spurred by the crisis, we see that the cost of this burden is steep indeed.</p>



<h3>Turning Burdens up to&nbsp;11</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/f31a8-1_kr4e7lhyo3potymberj4a.gif" alt="" /></figure></div>



<p>A key takeaway for me from the writing of Herd and Moynihan is that efforts to impact administrative burden can have a reinforcing effect. Efforts running in parallel to ease burdens can sometimes amplify each other:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…program simplification around the brand of BadgerCare [the name for the State of Wisconsin’s Medicaid program] lessoned burdens not only by reducing the number of forms an applicant had to complete, but also by facilitating marketing and outreach efforts around a single easily identifiable non stigmatizing program. <strong>Any approach to reducing burdens should therefore consider how different techniques can work together.</strong> [Emphasis added]</p></blockquote>



<p>It seems obvious now that this amplifying effect can work the other way as well, and that many of the issues we are seeing with state benefit systems are a result of this form of “burden reinforcement.”</p>



<p>Poor technology choices — many of them easily avoidable and relatively easy to correct — are reinforcing the existing administrative burden faced by applicants. The impact of these technology choices is often inadvertent, and distinct from technology implementations that may be made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/upshot/unemployment-state-restrictions-pandemic.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">specifically</a> to enhance burdens, and reduce access to programs or benefits.</p>



<p>What are some examples? This is far from an exhaustive list, but some that easily come to mind are:</p>

<p>None of these observations are new or original, and there are <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">some amazing resources available</a> that provide insights into the technology choices that support public benefit systems across all fifty states that are worth exploring in depth.</p>



<p>What seems overlooked in the literature about administrative burden that the current crisis helps underscore is that these poor technology choices can be “situationally burdensome,” amplifying burden more acutely when circumstances change. The environment in which burdens play out, and have an impact on those who apply for services, is dynamic. As circumstances change, design choices that may not have presented a significant burden to users in the past, can present new and unforeseen challenges.</p>



<p>For example, state unemployment benefits might be conditioned on an applicant certifying during the application process that they would return to work if offered a job. In most circumstances, including such a requirement in the application process might seem like a modest burden to impose (and one easily rationalized by policy makers). However, during a global pandemic, where returning to a shared workplace might present real health risks, it creates a dilemma for applicants. This policy choice carries a situational burden and dramatically impacts the learning and compliance costs of applying for benefits during a health crisis.</p>



<p>Similarly, a state that neglects to design a benefit system to scale adequately to meet demand runs the risk of imposing a situational burden. During times when demand for services are steady or relatively modest, these choices may not impose an undue burden on applicants. But when demand for a service spikes, applicants are often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/coronavirus-pandemic-unemployment-assistance-ny-delays.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">confronted with significant burdens</a> in accessing services.</p>



<h3>De-amplifying Burdens</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/b93cd-1ozupnzhhywv1sfzh1ad0zw.gif" alt="" /></figure></div>



<p>But why should we care so much about these kinds of technology choices, and the reinforcing impact they can have on the burden eligible recipients face in accessing services?</p>



<p>These choices serve to amplify the existing burden associated with accessing information or services from government, specifically learning and compliance burdens, by making a service more difficult to apply for using a technology device (a web browser or telephone). This amplified burden falls disproportionately on people with restricted access to technology, or who use less modern technology. So, correcting these issues will disproportionately benefit these populations as well.</p>



<p>These fixes <em>should</em> be non-controversial, and in some cases relatively easy. Correcting these mistakes won’t impact eligibility for a service, or requirements for receiving benefits — just the level of effort required to find out about a service, and comply with requirements.</p>



<p>Correcting these issues can also be a way to help underscore the importance of sound technology choices as a way to buffer against administrative burden. Helping policy makers and others in government understand why these choices amplify burden can act as a pathway to understanding the connection between properly implemented technology and sound policy execution.</p>



<p>One final reason why helping governments fix these common mistakes, that is often less talked about, is accountability. In her book <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Automating_Inequality.html?id=_TdCDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Automating Inequity</em></a><em>,</em> Virginia Eubanks provides a vivid and detailed description into the design of public benefit systems specifically engineered to reduce take-up by <em>eligible</em> recipients. She uses the example of the State of Indiana’s welfare automation effort to illustrate:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Indiana automated eligibility system enhanced the state’s already well-developed diversion apparatus…[b]y narrowing the gate for public benefits and raising the penalties for noncompliance, it achieved stunning welfare role reductions.</p></blockquote>



<p>Poor technology choices that reinforce burdens and make it more difficult for applicants to receive benefits can create confusion about <em>why</em> people don’t apply for or receive benefits. Is it because systems are designed to be punitive, and are engineered to remove eligible people from the benefit rolls more quickly? Or is it because the burden they present (or are perceived to present) to eligible applicants, through long wait times and confusing requirements, seems insurmountable and not worth the effort?</p>



<p>Our ability to hold our officials accountable for the policy choices they make is obscured when they can blame a lack of take-up for benefits on a website issue or technical glitch. Helping to ensure that sound technology choices are made is the best way to ensure that those eligible for public services receive them as quickly and as easily as possible.</p>



<p>It’s also the best way to ensure that our leaders are held accountable for the policy choices they make.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Famed management consultant Peter Drucker is often credited with the phrase “culture eats process (or strategy) for breakfast.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can’t change organizations by implementing new processes alone, so the thinking goes, you have to foster a new culture in order to drive real change. To understand the degree to which this idea is accepted as management philosophy gospel, we have but to count the number of times it is repeated at conferences, in meetings, or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/_jfeldman/status/1222660625794584576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a> by various thought leaders.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But when we think about changing the way public sector organizations work, particularly in how they acquire and manage new technology, this idea gets flipped. In the world of government technology, process eats culture for breakfast.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">One of the great truisms that underlies much of the work being done by digital service teams in governments around the world, and in civic tech communities, is that governments are not very good at adopting or managing new technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of general disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly — technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">People working in and around government digital transformation often take the position that the disfunction they see in public sector technology adoption is the result of a lack of knowledge or awareness on how to do something “the right way.” As a result, a great deal of energy and effort is expended telling governments how to do things differently when it comes to technology adoption. We often seek to develop a new culture in government organizations — one that values the input of users, embraces smaller projects and more speedy deployment, and highlights the value of cross functional teams.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But what if we proceeded from the assumption that there are people in government who generally know that they need to change the way they do things, but are unable to do so. Framed this way, the challenge for those of us working in government digital transformation becomes less about telling people <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what </em>to do, and more about understanding the barriers keeping them from doing things differently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The challenges facing governments as it relates to technology adoption are quite specific — there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. More importantly, each of these processes that hinder efficient technology adoption work <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">as designed</em>. They are not broken. They exist for a reason.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these processes are, and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically. If we don’t these process will end up eating the new culture we hope to bring to government organizations, and the problems we hope to solve will go on.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile development are all cultural changes that digital service teams try to bring to their partners in government agencies. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/03/13/win-big-by-going-small/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Each underscores the value of “smallness”</a> — breaking work down into smaller pieces and delivering them more quickly. This reduces risk, and helps us ensure we are delivering services that will address real user needs. There is also ample data showing that larger technology projects <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/BigBangBoom.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fail at a much higher rate than smaller ones</a>.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It’s no secret that reduced project sizes and more rapid delivery to users improves project success rates, but why is it still so common to see large technology projects with long delivery timelines in government?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Let’s think about the processes that impact how a government technology project gets funded, approved, and implemented. these includes things like the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/federal-budget-process.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget process</a>, intergovernmental <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding and governance processes</a>, and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://atos.open-control.org/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accreditation process</a> for software applications.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Federal and state budget processes begin many months before a single dollar ever gets spent. As much as 18 months before a budget is even enacted, the executive branch will transmit instructions to agencies for preparing the future budget request. This will include a complex set of documents that will capture the amount of funding that agencies will request , as well as a detailed justification for why they need it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies will need these detailed justifications as the embark on a months-long set of hearings where their requests are questioned and scrutinized over and over again, first by the executive budget office and then later by legislative committees. Digital service teams often engage with agency partners after a budget has already been enacted, and the agency is ready to spend the money that has been approved. It’s not uncommon for these teams to find the agency’s plans for spending approved funds to be overly detailed and prescriptive, suffering from all of the symptoms of the Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) approach.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The success of a digital service teams’ efforts in working with an agency partner like this typically depends on whether they can instill the culture of “smallness,” by adopting approaches like modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile. Unwinding these plans for overly large technology projects, which fail more often than smaller ones, is not always successful. What’s often missed is that the budget process that makes funding for these projects available doesn’t just allow large projects to happen, it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">incentivizes</em> them. It makes larger projects more likely than smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies that can describe in detail to executive branch officials and legislators exactly how they will spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 18–24 months in advance are the ones that get their projects funded. BRUF is a virtue in the process in which budgets get formulated and adopted. It’s a process tailor made to encourage a waterfall approach to projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are similar effects from other processes central to how technology projects get funded and approved. The process that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governs how states receive funding for systems to administer federal programs</a> (e.g., Medicaid) have similar waterfall- inducing features. When these processes require states to develop large, detailed plans up front for funding approval, and impose burdensome gated reviews checkpoints during project execution, it makes larger (and more complex, and riskier) projects <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> likely.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is also true of the processes whereby software applications are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2017/volume-2/navigating-the-us-federal-government-agency-ato-process-for-it-security-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accredited and granted approval to operate</a> — a key milestone in many government technology projects. In some federal agencies, this process can take many months, or even years. The process usually requires many steps, lots of manual work and is paperwork-intensive.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because agencies face these burdensome processes at key approval points in a technology project’s lifecycle, it’s not hard to understand why larger projects are more common. From the perspective of the agencies that must comply with gated reviews and ATOs, it’s rational to decide on a project approach that minimizes exposure to these processes. If iterative delivery of smaller project components requires an agency to navigate these labor and time intensive processes more frequently, it helps us understand more clearly why larger projects are more common.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">In the early days of government digital service teams, the goal was to bring a new culture to government — one that approached risk differently, and placed the needs of users at the center of the work. A decade or so into this work it, seems more obvious than ever that simply bringing a new culture to government technology projects won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Simply telling agencies what they need to do misses the influence of existing processes — all working exactly as designed — on technology project outcomes. The need to reform these fundamental processes underscores that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://peknet.com/2020/02/15/digital-service-is-not-about-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our most important work is not about technology</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>
<p><span id="more-4767"></span></p>
<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4773" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" alt="Hendricks Chapel" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg 1024w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=768&amp;h=511 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4773" class="wp-caption-text">Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University</p></div></p>
<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>

<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" alt="should" width="480" height="255" /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<p><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

<p id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve had the opportunity recently to talk to people in several different city governments that are facing a common challenge — <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">how to liberate operational data from a legacy system</span>.</p>
<p id="fdb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a challenge that lots of city governments face, and it strikes me that there are some common lessons that can be derived from cities that have gone down this road already for those that are still trying to figure out the right approach.</p>
<p id="0867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following suggestions are crafted from my own experience as a municipal government official charged with making data more widely available, and those of people in similar positions that I’ve had a chance to speak with.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4739"></span></p>
<p id="538a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope this helps someone in a city government that is currently facing this challenge.</p>
<h3 id="a933" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem</h3>
<p id="08fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’ve got operational data in a legacy system that you want to make more easily available to users inside of (and outside of) your city government.</p>
<p id="8565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may be a part of a larger data or analytics strategy that is spinning up, or a one-off request from the Mayor or other political leader for a specific project. Regardless of how it landed in your lap, the job is yours now.</p>
<p id="9a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">You’ve got to figure out the best way to provide access to data in a legacy system in a way that is both useful for others and maintainable by you</span>.</p>
<h3 id="fde9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Some Hurdles You’ll Face</h3>
<p id="0982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You probably won’t have additional resources allocated to support this project, and if the system in question is a bespoke solution created by a vendor they may want to charge you a handsome sum to do the work for you.</p>
<p id="e88e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is one of the first projects you’re undertaking to get operational data out of a legacy system for other purposes, you may not have a lot of the policy and technology infrastructure in place to support what you want to do. In a way this is a good thing — you have a greenfield opportunity to help shape policy and set up infrastructure that can be used to support a broader data strategy for your city. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to figure out what you need to get the job done on your own. As issues or questions arise, It will be your job to figure out how to address them.</p>
<p id="ca37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, you’ll have to make some definite choices technology wise. The good news is there are lots of different options for liberating data in legacy systems, and many are low cost and leverage open source software. However, different solutions may require different levels of technical expertise — some or all of which may be absent from your current IT environment. You’ll need to figure out how to introduce some new tools to your environment and — hopefully — keep them aligned with the skill sets of your staff and consistent with established IT policies.</p>
<p id="f1a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With these challenges in mind, here is a description of one approach that cities are using to take data from a legacy system and make it more easily usable by people inside and outside city government.</p>
<h3 id="548b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Extract, Transform, Load</h3>
<p id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first step in liberating data from a legacy system is to make a copy of it.</p>
<p id="a382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This seems pretty straightforward but it’s worth emphasizing as you consider how to get started. The use of your data for analytics and other purposes should occur outside of the environment your legacy system is currently running in.</p>
<p id="7b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your goal here is to make a separate copy of your production data that is stored outside of the production system that is using it. You want this copy to be as close to identical to your production data as possible (with the caveat that there there may be data in your legacy system that is not appropriate to share, or that is unable to be shred because of existing policy). And since regular usage of your production system will cause your copy to become stale over time, you want to make the process of generating a copy repeatable at regular (preferable short) intervals.</p>
<p id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sequence of steps is generally referred to in the world of data management as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). It’s a common need and there are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to do it well. That said, it can be difficult to cut through the noise around ETL, sift through the competing options, and select an approach or solution that is affordable and maintainable. Additionally, for governments that have a heterogeneous technology environment with lots of different legacy systems, more than one ETL approach may be required.</p>
<p id="0e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluating the ETL lifecycle in reverse can be a helpful way work through the issues:</p>
<h4 id="7cb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Load</h4>
<p id="ab7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Where are you going to put your data once you get it out of your legacy system?</p>
<p id="38fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational database platform (RDBMS) of some flavor probably makes the most sense. You can use an RDBMS with a whole bunch of commercially available reporting tools, and an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://redash.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increasing</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/ankane/blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">number</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.cluvio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud-based</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> tools. You can also use it to build an API (more on this below).</p>
<p id="f75b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Already got a database environment and licenses? You’re probably good to go. If not, think about where you’re going to house your data (on a machine racked in your data center, or somewhere in the cloud) and select a database solution that is a good fit for your current IT environment and employee’s skill sets.</p>
<h4 id="6173" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transform</h4>
<p id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The amount of transformation you’ll need to do on your data before loading it will depend on the system it is coming from. If your legacy data is already in an RDBMS you might be able to skip over this step and simply replicate from your production database to a backup.</p>
<p id="647a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, particularly if your data is in an older legacy system, you may need to extract it into an intermediate format (e.g., CSV) and alter it before loading it into another database. This is almost always a pretty solid approach — there are lots of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tools</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/scripts/csvsql.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a> for managing and manipulating these kinds of files, and for loading them into an RDBMS. These tools are scriptable and can be automated, making them easy to drop into your ETL toolchain.</p>
<p id="41d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If extracts from your legacy system are initially going to be infrequent (once a month or once a week) then you may be able to work through this process manually at first. As extracts become more frequent, you can start automating it incrementally, with the goal of having regular, frequent extracts occurring in a completed automated way.</p>
<h4 id="c169" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extract</h4>
<p id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the part of the ETL process that you don’t get to choose. Your data is in the system that it’s in — your challenge is to get it out of that system in a way that won’t disrupt its current operation and that is maintainable by you and/or other city IT staff.</p>
<p id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your data is already in an RDBMS, then there are undoubtedly utilities available to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replicate</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sqlserverdump.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backup</a> data (hopefully you are already using them). You should evaluate these options to decide which is best given your current scenario.</p>
<p id="9240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It your data is in an older system like an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/industry_insiders/2008/10/01/sql-server-using-ssis-to-retrieve-data-from-as400/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AS/400</a> or a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3438/importing-mainframe-data-with-sql-server-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mainframe system</a>, you may need to create a custom solution for extracting data. If you have vendors supporting these systems, you can inquire about potential approaches and pricing. But keep in mind — these systems are pretty common in municipal government. Your counterparts in other local governments face this same challenge and some have already figured out how to do it efficiently. Communicating with other government IT officials might be one of your most effective mechanism for extracting data from older legacy systems.</p>
<p id="ef6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve identified an ETL approach that works for you, you will have a copy of your production data in a separate system that is now ready to use. Depending on who wants to use this data, and how they want to use it, you’ll have several options for what to do next.</p>
<h3 id="fbe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Making Use of Your Data</h3>
<p id="47a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Replicating production data so that people in operation and policy offices can run reports is a pretty common use case. If this was the driver for liberating your data from a legacy system, then most of what remains is simply pointing your reporting tool of choice at your newly created database.</p>
<p id="2d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if you want to enable other uses for your data — e.g., using it to support a custom dashboard or application — or if you’re not sure what all of the uses for your data will be — you have some more decisions to make.</p>
<p id="362b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option that you have is to put your data in an open data platform. If your data liberation work is part of a larger effort to make data more accessible to external users, you may already have one of these (or you may soon be getting one). If not, then you can still use an open data platform to house your data for use in internal reporting, analytics and application development. There are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/10/open-data-portal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots of commercial and open source options</a> that can be run both on premise and in the cloud.</p>
<p id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to create an API for your data. This will allow you to tailor the way that users can access the data in a way that most effectively matches their use case. This option will, however, require you to make some technology choices.</p>
<p id="78f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every modern programming language has frameworks for building APIs, and odds are that you’ve already got some APIs running in your current IT environment (even if you didn’t build them). If your IT organization is a Microsoft shop (which is pretty common in municipal government), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">there are</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">great</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">options</a> for you to use to build an API. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform provides some nice options for hosting your data or your API application, as well as for <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p id="1a3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluate the options that most closely align with your current environment and that are a good fit for the talents of your existing IT staff, because odds are they are the ones that will have to manage it going forward.</p>
<h3 id="dbc6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Comes Next?</h3>
<p id="ff5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Whether you’ve put your data in an open data portal or created a standalone API, you now have an interface that you can manage that allows people to access your data. There are a few things you’ll need to think about to manage it effectively in the long run:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="aa24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who gets to use your API? Will they be required to authenticate to use it, or provide a key with calls to your API?</li>
<li id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you open up access to your API to a select group of users (e.g., those on your internal network, or at a specific IP range) or will it be available more broadly, for anyone to use?</li>
<li id="8d13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you manage traffic to your API to prevent abuse or overuse by specific users?</li>
<li id="cd97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you monitor your API to ensure it is up and operating properly?</li>
<li id="170f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you log requests to your API and do regular diagnostics?</li>
</ul>
<p id="c71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond general management of your API, (whether you realize it or not) you’re also going to need to provide some support for users of your API:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Will you provide examples to users for how they can make calls and get data from your API?</li>
<li id="5586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who do users contact if they are having a problem using your API?</li>
<li id="8a6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where do users go to ask questions, or learn more about how to use your API?</li>
<li id="723f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will users (internal or external) be able to suggest changes or enhancements to your API?</li>
</ul>
<p id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot to consider for a project that you may not have explicitly chosen to undertake in the first place.</p>
<p id="657b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re working with a vendor that has provided an open data portal, many of the things listed above may be in place already. And your vendor will likely have experience working with other customers — when in doubt ask your vendor to provide you with examples of how other customers are addressing a common issue.</p>
<p id="259b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve built a custom API, here are a few tips to you get started thinking about the issues listed above:</p>
<h4 id="3bc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lend users a hand</h4>
<p id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provide users with enough information to get them started using your API without having the have a human help them. Your IT staff will thank you.</p>
<p id="42a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invest some time in creating user facing materials with examples of how to make calls to your API, and a list of frequently asked questions. The more information you provide up front that makes it easy for users to start using your API the less phone calls and emails you’ll need to respond to.</p>
<p id="11b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, set up a way for users to report issues — a shared email box that is checked regularly is a good way to get started.</p>
<p id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up a way to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.runscope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">monitor the uptime of your API</a> so you’ll know when it’s down. This will allow you to get it back up quickly and also <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communicate to users</a> that you are aware of the problem (again, resulting in fewer phone calls and emails).</p>
<h4 id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Treat your API like a shared resource</h4>
<p id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You should treat an API like a shared resource because that’s exactly what it is — improperly managed, one consumers overuse of this resource can crowd out the legitimate use of others.</p>
<p id="36d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requiring authentication for users is one way to keep track of who is using your API, and issuing API keys is another option. Keep in mind, though, that if users can’t sign up quickly and easily without human intervention, then your phone will start to ring (or your inbox will start to fill up).</p>
<p id="999e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should strongly consider a way to rate limit usage of your API — there are a number of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commercial</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://getkong.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> API tools that can help you do this. You should also give thought to a caching strategy to improve the performance of your API — this includes not only setting up a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proxy cache</a>but also sending the appropriate <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caching headers</a> with your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="1415" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Plan for the future</h4>
<p id="8630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As your API gets used, the people using it will form opinions about what they like and what they don’t like. Give them a way to provide this input to you in a way that you can refer back to. This will help you prioritize changes and enhancements to your API going forward and ensure you are directing your finite resources to the things your users want most.</p>
<p id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll also want to think about things like versioning your API to allow you to gracefully deprecate features and add new ones.</p>
<p id="d14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data APIs are increasingly common in government, and there are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/application-programming-interfaces-apis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> that can help you work through these issues.</p>
<p id="6c6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge of getting operational data from a legacy system and using it to support an internal analytics project, or an external open data effort are increasingly common in municipal government. You’ll face challenges in getting started, but you can take comfort in knowing that lots of other local government IT leaders are traveling this same road. Sharing your experience and asking others to share theirs is an effective way of working through these issues.</p>
<p id="f989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t let the fact that you don’t know everything keep you from doing the things you can do right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4723" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2017/02/14/read-my-book/book-picture/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" data-orig-size="592,398" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="book-picture" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=592" class=" size-full wp-image-4723 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" alt="book-picture" width="592" height="398" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png 592w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300&amp;h=202 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p>The title of &#8220;Chief Data Officer&#8221; &#8211; once an uncommon one in state and municipal governments &#8211; is becoming less uncommon. And that’s a very good thing for public sector innovation.</p>
<p>As recently as a few years ago, Chief Data Officers were found almost exclusively in big city governments like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. Municipal governments provide services that touch citizens’ lives in more intimate ways than states or the federal government, and big cities have a critical mass of data that is attractive to the growing community of users with powerful tools for mapping and analyzing data. So it’s no surprise that <a href="http://publicsource.org/investigations/wolfs-plan-for-open-data-promising-pennsylvania-has-its-work-cut-out-for-it#.V7MwZZMrJ-V">cities have led the way</a> in creating new, data-focused positions like CDOs, and in releasing open data to the public.</p>
<p>But increasingly, state governments and small to midsized cities are <a href="http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html">appointing Chief Data Officers</a>, and creating new positions that focus almost exclusively on data. For example, earlier this year the City of Syracuse (a city of approximately 145,000 in Central New York) appointed <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/cdo">it’s very first Chief Data Officer</a>. It’s worth noting that this is not a stand alone position as in some other cities. The CDO position in Syracuse was deliberately made part of the city’s internal innovation team (which is funded through the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/">Bloomberg Philanthropies iTeam program</a>) and plays an integral part in the city’s efforts to use data internally to provide services more efficiently.</p>
<p><span id="more-4708"></span></p>
<p>In many ways, the newest cohort of Chief Data Officers being appointed in states and smaller cities highlights an important change in priorities for the CDO position, and for how governments view data as a part of their innovation efforts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opengovdata.org/">open data movement </a>&#8211; coordinated efforts to advocate for the release of data by governments in “open” formats &#8211; is an outgrowth of many earlier good government initiatives. The focus on transparency that was the hallmark of these early open data efforts largely informed the first cohort of Chief Data Officers in big cities like Chicago and Philadelphia. The first order of business for these newly appointed CDOs was the creation of <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/">public-facing web portals</a> that would allow external users to find and access government data. And while transparency remains a top priority of the open data movement, and building and expanding open data portals is still an important part a CDO’s work, the role of Chief Data Officer has started to evolve.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the focus of Chief Data Officers is on the internal use of data for more efficient resource allocation and improved operations. In other words, Chief Data Officers &#8211; once focused almost exclusively on making governments better <em>producers</em> of data &#8211; are increasingly focused on making governments better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>
<p>To some extent, this change in focus is born out of necessity. Governments at every level are under pressure to provide better service with limited resources. Data is a key element to streamlining operations and <a href="http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/municipal-analytics-the-startup-way-873">allocating scarce resources more efficiently</a>, and the tools and expertise for using data are becoming more attainable, even for smaller governments. But the more recent imperative for CDOs to enhance government operations using data and the original focus on government transparency are not mutually exclusive. In fact, these two areas of focus can complement each other, and help drive (and sustain) government innovation into the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic or organizational barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government &#8211; it’s not uncommon for one department to have difficulty obtaining data or information from another. Open data portals make data more discoverable – they obviate the need for special relationships, access or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use (including other government agencies), so fewer resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>When governments release data openly there are a number of very healthy incentives created by external data users. These users expect data to be complete, well documented and regularly updated – when this does not happen governments typically get quick feedback from unhappy users. Data that is regularly updated, well documented and otherwise easier to use has more value for every potential data user – including governments themselves.</p>
<p>So while the role of government Chief Data Officers is evolving, the traditional focus on transparency and sharing data with external users is still critical for governments to achieve their innovation goals.</p>
<p>A commitment to openness makes governments better <em>producers</em> of data, and better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>
