					<description><![CDATA[I think both are viable, but maybe not all of the time.

Certainly the dollars and cents stuff resonates with those in control of the purse strings, but quantifying &quot;openness&quot; and things like improved customer service through greater options for interacting can be difficult to measure sometimes.

As someone who loves getting caught up in the latest technology fads, I guess I&#039;m warning others not to. Sort of using myself as a cautionary tale I guess...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with your assessment. It&#039;s easy to put out a press release about Twitter but much harder to actually demonstrate that it helps govt deliver services more efficiently. We&#039;re asking the same question ourselves - how do we measure value in Gov 2.0 efforts? Is it defining ROI in dollars as Vivek did with Apps for Democracy? Or is it pointing to specific needs that were addressed through Gov 2.0 principles?]]></description>
