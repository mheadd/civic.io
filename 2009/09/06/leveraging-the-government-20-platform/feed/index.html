					<description><![CDATA[Cool - so the RSS feed includes bills that have been acted upon within a specific period, correct? Would this include a bill that was just introduced (and referred to its initial committee for consideration)?

I had some of the same thoughts that you did, about being able to proactively notify someone when an action is taken on a bill. I was thinking it would be neat to allow someone to &quot;subscribe&quot; to a bill through one of the channels listed above. So, for example, when someone sends a tweet to @opensenate to get the current status of a bill, they could then send a follow up like &quot;#notify S1234&quot; to be notified of future changes in the status of a bill.

These notification requests would need to be persisted somewhere - probably just require the addition of a database backend to the app.  If the OpenLeg RSS feed includes changes for a specific time period, it should be pretty straightforward to use it to find out which bills have seen a status change, query the database to see if the bills have any &quot;subscribers&quot; and then send out a notice to the end user on the same channel they used to subscribed.

Just thinking out loud here, but I think its a viable approach.

I like the idea of weaving bills into the conversations on social networks - I see you have Facebook and Twitter integration in the discussion section of the bill summaries.  I need to try that and add a comment to a bill or two.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is fantastic work, Mark. I&#039;m flattered and relieved to have a developer of your quality and vision to be utilizing our OpenLeg API. I am working on a big update to the open.nysenate.gov home page and will plan to include your work in a showcase section. Voxeo/IMified is a neat platform to build on, especially with their support for XMPP.

As a side note, have you noticed the RSS feeds we now have available? That is what is powering: http://twitter.com/nysenateopenleg 

I am really interested in getting data proactively pushed out and indexed, where citizens don&#039;t have to go and seek out information, but it is instead weaved into the conversation throughout the web, social networks and more.]]></description>
