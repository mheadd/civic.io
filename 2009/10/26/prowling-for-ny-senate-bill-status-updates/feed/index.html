					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the polling is probably the big challenge with this right now.  Using something like PubSubHubBub would make this a lot more efficient.  Not sure if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter streaming API&lt;/a&gt; would work, but that might be worth a look as well.

The other big challenge is storing subscription preferences -- there will need to be a way to store at least 3 pieces of information:

 * The bill number the user wants to subscribe to;
 * The medium that they want to receive notice through; and,
 * Their user name / phone number to send the alert to.

Then each time the RSS feed is updated, a process would need to check and see who had subscribed to bills where a status change is made, and then send out a notice using the appropriate channel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant, as always! The ability to subscribe to alerts for change in status is definitely a big step forward. I&#039;ve been working on this via Twitter.... I have also been thinking about supporting something like PubSubHubBub to support this without requiring you to poll.
