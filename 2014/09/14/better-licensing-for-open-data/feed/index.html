					<description><![CDATA[We (Open North with some data.gov folks) are currently starting within the OGP open data working group around open data standardization. Licence (and metadata) is a major aspect since it prevents discoverability of the data and its possible usage.

Most of our analysis will be based on open data portals (which usually have metadata support even if frequently not used as it should). Hosting on Github adds a layer of complexity since it is not designed to support metadata (although there is a convention for the licence).

That&#039;s why when I am asked about using GitHub for open data portal, I am hesitant. There are some obvious positive aspects but there are some obvious drawback. Lot of works still needed to make open data as accessible as we would expect!!]]></description>
