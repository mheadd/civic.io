					<description><![CDATA[The City of Charlotte&#039;s Code for America fellowship in 2014 generated http://www.citygram.org/ which, in its final incarnation, would find this output to a webhook very natural.  The maintenance and sustainability of that program has fallen to me (and the Charlotte brigade) so it&#039;s a volunteer effort, but we are excited about Citygram and its future!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looking forward to more realtime data coming online. It&#039;s definitely a chicken / egg problem. Twitter realtime visualizations are prevalent because the data are so easily accessible. There is tremendous possible potential to re-apply that same energy to municipal data, if we can make it as easy and attractive to work with.

This week we launched &quot;Stream Services&quot; - this should enable any GIS department to start publishing sensor/vehicle feeds via WebSockets. We&#039;re hoping this can be yet another enticement for organizations to start streaming data, not just publishing it.

					<description><![CDATA[Woah - really looking forward to seeing the updates to open311status.org. Very cool!

&quot;...perhaps a requirement of realtime is a deeper integration of the public API with the backend data and processing system.&quot;

Completely agree. That&#039;s pretty common, not just with 311 systems but with other stuff as well. But I wonder how much an increased demand for data that is realtime will help to foster this change. If people start using your realtime feed for Open311, will it help to highlight the fact that the underlying data push is done in batches?

Will be interesting to see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently working on a realtime feed for Open311 requests across multiple cities (finally updating open311status.org. It&#039;s somewhat bittersweet though because very little 311 data actually updates in realtime, instead it seems to be batch-published at certain intervals. It&#039;s nice to get that data pushed when it is published, but it&#039;s somewhat less exciting than a true realtime stream. 

...which is to wonder at a more granular level what level of integration is required for realtime data. Open311 is often bolted on to another system, which means it itself is doing batch-polling. So perhaps a requirement of realtime is a deeper integration of the public API with the backend data and processing system.]]></description>
