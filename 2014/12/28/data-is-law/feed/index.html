					<description><![CDATA[&quot;i think they should offer both. offering the data in bulk would make the service better for data junkies, businesses, research teams, etc. offering the data in html would make the service better for users and bots.&quot;

Completely agree. When I worked at the City of Philadelphia, this is exactly the approach we took in designing new digital services. 

For example, when looking up a specific property using the city&#039;s property look up app: http://property.phila.gov/#account/883309000

And when looking for API access to the same information: http://api.phila.gov/opa/v1.1/property/5356001234?format=json]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m not aware of any govs using microformats either. 
i agree that the philly service should use json/csv here, but that wasn&#039;t my point. i think they should offer both. 
offering the data in bulk would make the service better for data junkies, businesses, research teams, etc.
offering the data in html would make the service better for users and bots.
the way its set up now, loading the data onto the same page, etc., doesn&#039;t quality in my opinion as publishing in html properly. each report or business should be in a separate document with its own url.
i&#039;m not arguing html vs json/csv. i think they all have their place and are equally important.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to see more governments use microformats. Not aware of any god examples of that - might be an interesting research project.

When it comes to HTML, most governments that are using this as a format for their data are only thinking about one use case - human eye balls. There is often little thought to how the data behind an HTML web page might be used outside of the web page it is presented on.

For example, take a look at this site for displaying restaurant inspection reports from the City of Philadelphia - http://www.phila.gov/health/foodprotection/FoodSafetyReports.html

How much better would this service be if the raw data behind t was available in JSON or CSV?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Public data is available for viewing, typically as an HTML page (or series of pages)&quot;
&quot;Open data is specifically formatted for use by machines &quot;

microformats have been making html machine-readable for a long time now; html is the first or second (depending on your source) most utilized semwebtech alive today.

whenever possible, i publish data in html as well as other typical formats like csv or json. the markup gives the user something to immediately consume.
it increases the findability of the data by giving the bots more to harvest for the search engines. 
properly implemented html can also extend the data&#039;s reach in terms of usability and accessibility

i see the benefits of good markup being endless, and when applicable, should be a standard format when publishing open data. 

the crucial intersection with open gov only furthers this: properly formatted markup doesn&#039;t have cross-browser/platform issues, doesn&#039;t require proprietary software to run, and is consumable by assistive technologies.

it seems like html is an afterthought (if anything....i&#039;m looking at you markdown) in the world of civic hacking....so i gotta ask why? or have i missed the elephant in the room that has everyone steering clear of it?]]></description>
