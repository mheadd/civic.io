					<description><![CDATA[Great post! 

I wonder if financial support is really the missing ingredient. There are a lot of other differences between firefighting and adopting a street on one hand and current civic hacking practice on the other.

1. Noncompetition -- we don&#039;t have volunteer firefighters and professional firefighters in the same district. It seems difficult to sustain volunteering when some people get paid for providing the same service that the volunteers are providing for free. By and large, the software solutions procured by governments are of very different scale and type than what civic hackers are interested in providing. Sometimes they are not. After a group of volunteers made http://www.chicagolobbyists.org/, the city issued an RFP for a lobbyist disclosure site that was very similar to the volunteer&#039;s offering. Because the volunteers were not ready to organize themselves into the kind of organization that could bid for the RFP, the contract went to traditional vendor. The contract still has not been fully delivered. This story is often told as an example of what&#039;s wrong with procurement, but it could be told as a story about how to squash voluntary civic hacking. With modest encouragement, and no government contract, Chicago could probably have gotten a great lobbyist disclosure site from the original volunteers. 

2. Real stakes and real partners -- A lot of the attempts to work with civic hackers have been for relatively minor operational improvements. In part this is because you don&#039;t get to work with volunteers without giving up some control about how the work gets done and how it gets communicated to the public. The lack of control is scary for governments. On the other side, you&#039;ll get better volunteers if they believe that the work is meaningful. 

3. Lack of relevant knowledge -- Firefighters are highly trained in how to fight fires, and just about anyone can pick up trash. Making meaningful interventions in the operations and communication of government functions is hard, and the necessary knowledge and skill is only somewhat related to knowing how to make a good website. Our civic hacking communities are maturing in their understanding of complicated policy and operational issues, but it&#039;s still early.]]></description>
