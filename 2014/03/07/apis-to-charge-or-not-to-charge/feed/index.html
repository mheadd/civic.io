					<description><![CDATA[Glad to see such discussions starting, as it is a clear sign of the space maturing.

Toll roads example is a good analogy, with one caveat: roads are purely utalitarian resources, while OpenData APIs definitely have the role of transparency and keeping gov&#039;t in check. As such, it is extremely important to have free tier of all gov&#039;t APIs.

That said, if somebody builds a popular app using a gov&#039;t API and ends-up making hundreds of thousands of API queries per day, from the paid app: it&#039;s fair to pay.

I think free vs. paid model should definitely take into account level of usage, but also depend on whether the derivative work is free or commercial. If somebody creates a very useful free app, using the API, making them pay could kill such app and eliminate public service. Which would be counter to the motivation of creating open data APIs, in the first place.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting reflexion. 

I hear more and more organizations saying that even open data might not be easy to sustain and for example the city of Lyon decided to have a 2-tier licence: free for non-commercial use, with a fee for commercial use. I don&#039;t like it because once the data (if static file) is out, there is no reason to charge some users (and I am not sure to understand how they make the difference concerning commercial/non commercial with online ads for example) but it raises the question of the cost of stewarding the data).

In a recent API implementation for CanLii (legislation and cases database for Canada), it was decided that below a given level of use (500 requests/day), access is free while higher frequency requested (as well as advanced feature) comes with a fee.
