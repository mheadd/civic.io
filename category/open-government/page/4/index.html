	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>There&#8217;s a discussion starting on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/us-government-apis/mQlwYRK5Y_0">U.S. Government API Google Group</a> on the subject of charging for the use of government APIs.</p>
<p>This is an interesting discussion (one that governments should pay attention to as they develop their API strategies) and is a nice follow up to my last post on <a href="../../../../2014/03/02/on-sustainable-civic-technology/index.html">sustainable civic technology</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly the decision about whether to charge users for accessing an API &#8211; whether to query an open data source, or to conduct some transaction with government &#8211; is one that each government needs to come to on their own after factoring in the potential benefits and consequences. But there are at least a few economic reasons that governments might want to consider whether charging for access to APIs makes sense.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any definitive answers here, but I think there are a few questions worthy of further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying who is using government APIs</strong></p>
<p>In economic parlance, public goods are characterized by two different factors &#8211; &#8220;rivalry&#8221; and &#8220;excluability.&#8221; Rivalry refers to the idea that some goods can be consumed simultaneously with other consumers without a diminished experience. Public goods are those that I can enjoy myself along with my neighbors and our simultaneous enjoyment of such a good doesn&#8217;t diminish the experience for any one of us, or anyone else.</p>
<p>Excludability refers to the idea that consumers of a good can be identified with relative ease, and that their consumption of a good may easily be conditioned on something. Such goods are often referred to as &#8220;toll goods&#8221; and the most often cited example of such a good is a toll road &#8211; a turnpike or highway.</p>
<p>Its fairly easy to restrict access to a toll road and condition the use of the resource on paying a tool (that&#8217;s what toll booths are for). This arrangement has the additional benefit of directing the cost for building and maintaining the resource on those that are actually using it. People that don&#8217;t drive aren&#8217;t subject to tolls, and there is a pretty strong argument that they shouldn&#8217;t be (because they&#8217;re not consuming the resource).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also fairly trivial to restrict access to a government API by requiring an API key or other credentials. Because API consumption shares much in common with the consumption of other toll goods, is there a justification for governments to charge for access? How strong is the argument that the cost to build and maintain the infrastructure behind APIs should be borne more directly by those that actually use them?</p>
<p><strong>APIs as a shared resource</strong></p>
<p>Another rationalization for charging for the consumption of certain goods and services is that price is an effective way of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing">rationing a scare resource</a>. APIs &#8211; particularly those that expose open data &#8211; are fundamentally different than something like a static data download. APIs are shared services with finite resources &#8211; my use of an API has the potential to impact other users of an API, depending on how I consume it.</p>
<p>Is it fair to allow one user, or a few users, of an API to potentially diminish the experience of other users by using it with enough frequency to impact performance? Even the most elegantly and expansively engineered APIs have limits &#8211; is price a way that governments can help ensure responsible use of an API?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that many SaaS and PaaS service providers offer a free tier for relative less intensive use of their platforms or APIs, and charge users at different levels based on the amount of usage for what is essentially a shared resource. Is this an approach that governments should emulate?</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability of IT infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, if and how a government employs a fee structure for access to APIs should be connected to plans for long-term sustainability of the IT infrastructure support the API. As I&#8217;ve said before, far too often governments <a href="../../../../2014/03/02/on-sustainable-civic-technology/index.html">do not budget properly for the long term care of IT assets</a>.</p>
<p>Could charging for access to government APIs generate a reliable revenue stream to help ensure resource for upkeep, maintenance and improvements to the systems behind these APIs?</p>
<p>At a minimum, governments should consider deploying a test environment for their APIs. If governments charge users for access to their APIs, they should allow new users and developers to experiment and build new apps without incurring costs, until they are ready to go to production. </p>
<p>I think a far more interesting question for governments is how many are deploying test environments that allow users to build new things without impacting production users. This is an area that I think many governments should spend some time exploring as they develop their API strategies.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>Sustaining civic technology will mean that both government&#8217;s IT infrastructure and the civic technology sector that builds on it will need to change.</p>
<p>A pair of recent blog posts caught my eye and highlighted this theme in my head, and motivated me to capture a few thoughts on this topic.</p>
<p>The first post was by Dan O&#8217;Neil, Executive Director of the Smart Chicago Collaborative. <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2014/02/some-thoughts-toward-the-maturation-of-the-civic-innovation-sector-of-the-technology-industry.html">Dan&#8217;s post</a> on the the things that need to happen to drive the &#8220;&#8230;maturation of the civic innovation sector of the technology industry&#8221; are worth the read. It&#8217;s a great post that helps highlight the connection between legacy IT system in government and open data, which is used to build civic technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;[without] existing legacy gov IT systems, there would be no civic tech. The data we use for our civic tech projects doesn’t get collected, managed, and exported by itself.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The second post is from the Bay Area design firm Stamen, and highlights the need for data visualizations (and other bits of civic technology that rely on open data) to be maintained over time. The post <a href="http://content.stamen.com/a_tale_of_two_cities_maps">uses the analogy of gardening</a> to underscore the need to constantly update and maintain the things we build with data.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If you plant a flower in a garden and then never give it water or light, it will in fact die. Unless, of course, it happens to placed in just the perfect spot, in which case it will need to be pruned. Either way, some kind of tending is always required.</p>
<p>We don’t always think of digital works in the same way, perhaps because their metaphor of creation more closely resembles that of a built object, like a bookcase or building. But even buildings need maintenance, and after so many years, the shelves on the bookcase may falter and need new ones. We need to be more conscious about this aspect of dynamic data visualization, at the outset.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>These two posts call out the need for both the government technology systems that lie at the foundation of open data, and the civic technology that uses this data to get better. To mature. To advance to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, the takeaways from these two posts are pretty clear.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and civic apps are like gardening &#8211; except when they&#8217;re not.</strong></p>
<p>I like the analogy of gardening applied to investment in technology solutions. It underscores the need to continually invest in the maintenance and upkeep of the solutions that are used to consume government data. However, I think there is some danger in using this analogy in that it obscures the the fundamental nature of change in the technology world. </p>
<p>I can tend my garden today in pretty much the same way as someone did 100 years ago &#8211; soil, water and sunshine. Boom. However, when building a technology solution (particularly web-based solutions) its not feasible to use the same approach or components that might have been acceptable as recently as 10 years ago. Budgeting for maintenance and enhancements for technology projects isn&#8217;t a nice to have &#8211; its absolutely essential to their success. The pace of change in the world of technology is just too fast for anything less.</p>
<p><strong>We have to fix the budget process as it relates to investment in technology.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">harped on this before</a>, but we most definitely need to get better at helping non-technology people in government (particularly budget officials) understand the need for continuous support and maintenance of IT projects. Correction &#8211; we need to help them understand technology better in general. Not since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(U.S._TV_series)#Seasons">first season of The Bachelor</a> has there been a worse match than the current public budgeting process and the pace of change in the world of technology.</p>
<p>To understand how acute this problem is, ask some you know that works in state or local government if they (or someone they work with) interacts as part of their job with a technology system that is 10 years old or older. I think the responses would be surprising to many people, and rather alarming to most professional technologists.</p>
<p><strong>Government needs to embrace its role as a data steward</strong></p>
<p>Governments need to understand their role in the civic technology production chain. The current public budgeting and procurement processes make us lousy at investing in the kinds of technology that chance rapidly &#8211; like those that power web-based solutions. </p>
<p>When I read the post by Stamen about their Crimespotting project with the City of Oakland, I see a city that hasn&#8217;t accepted its role as a mature data steward:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;over the years, the project started wavering. Oakland’s API has sputtered to the point of being nonfunctional, rendering Oakland Crimespotting totally spotless.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If governments are serious about open data, they need to invest in systems that will make their data easy to consume and readily available &#8211; without this, the civic technology sector won&#8217;t go far. </p>
<p>I think part of this is <a href="../../../../2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/index.html">accepting the role of data steward</a>, and engineering our IT infrastructure accordingly. I don&#8217;t know if Stamen&#8217;s was the only project consuming the Oakland crime data API, but building a robust community of users around open data can help public officials see the importance of investing to keep these systems stable and available.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t underestimate the  power of open source</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to helping ensure that civic technology solutions continue to thrive after launch, there is almost nothing better than leveraging the power of open source. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with closed source solutions built on top of open data, but if governments are paying for custom solutions from vendors to display open data we should <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia/myPhillyRising">insist that the underlying code be open sourced</a>. This can go a long way toward helping ensure that it continues to evolve over time, as civic technologists contribute fixes and enhances and (potentially) as other governments fork these solutions for their own use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see the conversation around civic technology and open data focused on how we can take the great work that has been done to the next level. I think it means we&#8217;re ready for the next steps.</p>

		<p>Governments make a wealth of data available on their public websites.</p>
<p>Forward thinking governments have take steps to ensure that more and more of this information is available in <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#open-formats">open formats</a>. But the majority of the data available on government websites &#8211; even those with formal open data policies, like Philadelphia &#8211; is not open. It is merely &#8220;public.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What is Public Data?</strong></p>
<p><em>Public data</em> is available for viewing, typically as an HTML page (or series of pages), a PDF document or in some similar format suitable for publishing on the web. It is meant to be consumed by eyeballs, not by computer programs or applications.</p>
<p>It is possible to access public data in a programatic fashion through the use of scraping tools that are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2861/options-for-html-scraping">available in most programming languages</a>, through services like <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">ScraperWiki</a> or even using something as simple as <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3093339">Google Docs</a>.</p>
<p>However, writing web scrapers &#8211; even though the technology options for doing so have advanced tremendously in recent years &#8211; is tedious and the notion is unappealing to most data users. In addition, there are a number of reasons why making important data available solely as public data is undesirable.</p>
<p><strong>An Example: Scraping Tax Balance Data</strong></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3bVoBgLHm8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve never met the person that recorded the screencast above, but data on property tax balances in Philadelphia was important enough to them to invest the time to write a data scraper. (This data currently only exists as public data &#8211; viewable one record at a time &#8211; on the web site of the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/realestatetax/">Philadelphia Department of Revenue</a>.)</p>
<p>The screencast this individual recorded and posted to YouTube serves as a strong indicator that this data should be prioritized for release by the City of Philadelphia as open data. Until it is made available in this way, more people will be forced to obtain this important data by writing scrapers, or through <a href="http://www.phila.gov/privacy/pdfs/FinalCityOpenRecords.pdf">alternate channels</a>.</p>
<p>Property tax data is an ideal example to illustrate the problems of public data in the context of a city that has a formal open data policy. It meets every conceivable definition of the term &#8220;high value&#8221; data &#8211; the fact that external users go out of their way to write data scrapers should be enough to confirm this.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a strong correlation between <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2013/03/09/part-one-lax-property-tax-enforcement-and-brazen-deadbeat-investors-have-depressed-philadelphia-s-property-tax-base-by-9-5-billion">tax delinquency and vacant properties</a>, and research is currently underway at Rutgers University&#8217;s School of Criminal Justice on the relationship between tax delinquency and the incidence of serious crimes in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This is data that people want so that they may better understand how their city works, and may explore ways that they can make it work better.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations</strong></p>
<p>High value data that is only made available as public data presents a number of problems for both data users, and for governments that produce such data.</p>
<p>Forcing people to employ web scrapers places an unneeded barrier in front of what should be open data. Furthermore, it limits the number of users that can access such data &#8211; not all data users are technically sophisticated enough to create and use web scrapers. Even for those who are, writing scrapers is almost never desirable &#8211; it&#8217;s tedious, can be very time consuming and most scrapers are brittle pieces of technology that get thrown away once the desired data is obtained.</p>
<p>For governments, the problems created by web scraping can be significant. Scrapers can place an unnecessary burden on IT infrastructure &#8211; disrupting normal operations and causing problems for more mainstream data users (those that may want to view data one record at a time). When inelegantly designed scrapers send non-trivial amounts of web traffic to a government site, it can create problems that IT staff must identify and troubleshoot. This wastes value staff time on problems that are easily avoided.</p>
<p>In addition, by failing to make data available in more easily consumable formats governments might be missing opportunities to use such data to <a href="../../../../2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/index.html">improve their own operations</a>. What if every interaction with city government by a taxpayer (a citizen or a business &#8211; residents &amp; nonresidents alike) could include an API call to check for outstanding property taxes?</p>
<p>Open data can make such an operational improvement a reality &#8211; by making data more accessible and more usable for the public, governments also make data more usable by their own operating units.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Considerations</strong></p>
<p>But the strongest criticisms of public data derive from the principles that guide most open data policies &#8211; including the <a href="https://gist.github.com/PhillyCDO/3623582">City of Philadelphia&#8217;s policy</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;agencies shall publish information on line (in addition to other planned or mandated publication methods), and in an open format. The open format will provide data in a form that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, searched and reused by commonly used web search applications and software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Making valuable data &#8220;public&#8221; but not &#8220;open&#8221; is a departure from the principles outlined in most open data policies. Some more cynical observers have suggested that it is a way for government officials to lay claim to the ideals of open data while ensuring that information remains difficult to use for serious analysis. This may be why the vast majority of campaign finance and lobbying information published by governments is made available in PDF format only.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>Any government that has a formal open data policy should target and prioritize data that is being scraped for release as open data. In the absence of such a prioritization, we may struggle to meet our objectives for openness and government transparency, we may miss real opportunities to improve government operations and we are likely creating avoidable problems for our IT staff and technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>Clean, well documented, public APIs accompanied by static data downloads should be the standard we strive for with public data releases of high value data.</p>
<p>[Note &#8211; In December, 2015 (almost 2 years after I wrote this post and began working inside the City of Philadelphia to release property tax balance data) the city <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/property-tax-balances">released this data as open data</a>.]</p>

		<p>A few lessons learned and insights gained serving as a municipal Chief Data Officer &#8211; I hope this will be of value to anyone interested in starting an open data program.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;padding:2px;margin-left:13px;" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/hang-picture.jpg?w=273&#038;h=300" alt="hang-picture" width="273" height="300" /></p>
<p>Helping to create an open data culture in government is a process, not an outcome. It takes time. Though it may sometimes seem easier to shame people into releasing data, or to find ways around seemingly unreasonable objections, getting public officials to &#8220;own&#8221; the process of opening up their data is a key part of building this culture. But&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> listen to people that tell you to &#8220;take pride in how far you&#8217;ve come in such a short time.&#8221; This kind of attitude assumes that your job is almost done and you can be satisfied in what you&#8217;ve accomplished. You should focus not on how much you have already done, but on how much you have left to do. You have lots and lots more work left. Trust me.</p>
<hr />
<p>When appointed or elected officials release open data, or adopt innovative change, it&#8217;s critical to do what you can to make sure they get recognized for it &#8211; do this regardless of their party or political affiliation. Transparency is more important than politics. But&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> let people feel like they&#8217;re doing you a favor, or going beyond the call of duty by releasing open data. If your city has an executive order covering open data then they are following a directive issued by the Mayor. If your city has an open data statute then they are following the law. You don&#8217;t get special credit for following the law.</p>
<hr />
<p>Always be respectful of elected or appointed officials and understand that as important as you believe your job is, theirs is equally important. Not everyone will believe in what you&#8217;re trying to do as strongly as you do, but they will recognize if your actions are sincere. Find ways to frame open data and government innovation in ways that support the mission of their departments or agencies. Show them how their jobs can be made easier by embracing change. But&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> become close or chummy with elected or appointed officials. It makes it more difficult to have the hard conversations when they&#8217;re needed. Some confrontation and uncomfortable meetings, where you remind people of their obligations under an open data policy, are inevitable. You should not seek out a fight if it can be avoided, but you also shouldn&#8217;t shrink from one if it can&#8217;t.</p>
<hr />
<p>Take pride in the fact that you are a public servant. I believe strongly in the value of public service and that spending time in government working to make change happen is important. I rearranged my life and moved my family to a new state for the opportunity to serve a city that I have come to love. But&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> hang any pictures in your office. Don&#8217;t get comfortable. Recognize that your time in public service is temporary. The office I currently occupy looks much like it did 519 days ago when I walked into it. The contents of the cabinets and desk drawers are those that the previous occupant left behind. There are no decorations, few items with sentimental value, nothing to suggest permanence.</p>
<p>You should be a little nervous &#8211; at all times &#8211; that you may have pushed too hard and the city fathers and mothers will grow weary and decide that your services are no longer needed.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t feel that way, you&#8217;re probably not pushing hard enough.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>2013 was <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/12/20/the-year-in-local-open-data/">a big year</a> for municipal open data, but I think 2014 will be even bigger.</p>
<p>Last year saw the development of an interesting dialog on open data focused on the proper goals for government open data programs. With their roots in transparency efforts, a growing number of people observed that open data programs seemed to be <a href="../../../../2013/06/20/keeping-the-faith-on-open-data/index.html">moving away from their primary objectives</a> &#8211; making government more accountable &#8211; and gravitating toward other goals like economic development and <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">promoting entrepreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>And while this is a highly valuable discussion to have, I think an even more important discussion is brewing &#8211; a discussion about the role that open data will play in fostering innovation and change inside government.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../../../2013/06/22/why-publish-open-data/index.html">touched on this subject before</a>, but I think that open data has almost limitless potential to change the way the governments themselves work. In fact, I believe that nothing has the potential to drive more innovation inside of government than open data programs originally designed to share data with consumers outside of government.</p>
<p><strong>The Bezos Mandate</strong></p>
<p>Steve Yegge&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">famous rant about Amazon.com</a> provided some invaluable insights into how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> turned Amazon the book seller into the company that runs a large portion of the Internet. In a nutshell, Bezos told his employees at Amazon that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">services</a> would be the way that different parts of the organization communicated going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</li>
<li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</li>
<li>There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team&#8217;s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols &#8212; doesn&#8217;t matter. Bezos doesn&#8217;t care.</li>
<li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be <strong>externalizable</strong>. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</li>
<li>Anyone who doesn&#8217;t do this will be fired.</li>
<li>Thank you; have a nice day!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that the service interfaces created and used inside the company had to be designed with the ability to make them available publicly has been a key to Amazon&#8217;s success. The relevant parallel for open data is that we are starting to see a similar trend emerge in governments that have mature open data programs &#8211; <a href="http://phlapi.com/">data and APIs</a> created for external consumption are increasingly becoming valuable as operational assets for other parts of government.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government, so it is often the case that what should be easy isn&#8217;t. Could we condition the denial of a permit from city government on whether a person has an outstanding tax liability, an outstanding parking ticket, a violation against a property they own, or an outstanding utility bill? Doing this requires querying data sets that fall under the purview of an array of different departments and agencies across the government footprint. It also requires the development of systems that integrate all this data and allow it to be used as part of a well defined process.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Culture of Sharing</strong></p>
<p>There are at least three good reasons why open data helps enable these kinds of changes within municipal governments.</p>
<p>First, open data programs make data <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">discoverable</a> &#8211; it obviates the need for special relationships or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use, so few resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>Second, open data programs make data more usable &#8211; they create incentives for governments to describe their data for people that are not domain experts, and to build <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/government?apicat=Government">services</a> for easier and more efficient use of data.</p>
<p>Third, open data programs create a &#8220;culture of sharing&#8221; within government. As noted in a <a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/annual_report_2013.pdf">recently released data analytics report</a> from the City of New York &#8211;<em> Aggregating cross-agency data is often first a political, legal, and cultural discussion</em>. Whether created by statute, executive order or some other vehicle, open data directives send a clear message to the bureaucracy that data sharing is not only beneficial, but expected.</p>
<p>Government open data flips the Bezos Mandate around by encouraging the development of service interfaces that are &#8220;internalizable,&#8221; and can drive innovation inside of government. By creating data resources (downloads and API) for external consumption, open data programs make data immensely more usable inside government.</p>
<p><strong>Frictionless Data Drives Innovation</strong></p>
<p>The many benefits to internal government innovation from external open data depend on how successful governments are in making their data useful to outside consumers. Data that is complete, updated, well documented and available via an API is more likely to be used.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/12/how-apis-fuel-innovation/">private sector companies driving innovation through the use of APIs</a>, and plenty of examples of governments that need to <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2013/12/30/data-user-experience/">step up their game</a>. We have <a href="../../../../2013/09/17/the-lesson-of-pennapps/index.html">a lot more work to do</a> in order to make the use of government data frictionless.</p>
<p>There is an amazingly powerful dynamic at work within properly constructed open data programs &#8211; the more useful we make open data for users outside of government, the more potential we have to drive innovation and efficiencies inside of government.</p>

		<blockquote><p>This season, influenza activity started about 4 weeks early and was intense. Influenza-like-illness rose quickly to well above the baseline of expected activity and remained elevated for 15 consecutive weeks, making this season slightly longer than average.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2012-2013-flu-season-wrapup.htm">2012-2013 Flu Season Wrap Up</a>, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">When open data and an acute problem meet, great civic apps are often born.</p>
<p>Last year in Chicago, the acute problem was the more severe than anticipated flu season and the powerful civic app it helped to foster was <a href="https://github.com/tkompare/chicagoflushots">Chicago Flu Shots</a> by software developer <a href="http://about.me/tomkompare">Tom Kompare</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developed for the Chicago Department of Public Health, Kompare’s flu shot finder was incorporated into the City’s official web site and served as the flagship application for helping Chicagoans quickly and easily find locations near them where flu shots were being dispensed. As important as this was, the Chicago Flu Shots app would go on to have an even broader impact &#8211; beyond the borders of the City of Chicago &#8211; before the raging flu season had ended.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/flu-shots.jpg?w=187&#038;h=250" alt="flu-shots" width="187" height="250" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Making it quick and easy to find a location that dispenses flu vaccinations is an ideal problem for a civic app to help solve.  Information on flu shot locations and schedules can be easily displayed via a web site, mobile app, or even via SMS, and can be easily integrated into a personal calendar or reminder app. In addition, data on where flu vaccinations are dispensed are usually compiled &#8211; albeit in widely differing formats &#8211; by local public health officials.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the more vexing challenges facing public health officials during flu season is not just making people aware of the availability of vaccinations but also getting people to follow through and receive them. It’s far too easy for many of us to continually delay receiving vaccinations because of perceived inconvenience. Not only does Chicago Flu Shots display the location where vaccinations are being dispensed, it also shows details like cost, eligibility and hours of operations, and even provided directions from the user’s location to the facility dispensing vaccinations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several weeks after being implemented in Chicago, Chicago Flu Shots &#8211; which Kompare made freely available on the code sharing site GitHub &#8211; was “forked” and implemented in Boston. Then in Philadelphia. In each successive instance where it was implemented, local developers used data obtained from the new host city’s public health agency. What started out as a notable civic app for its high profile use in Chicago went on to become a prime example of the potential impact of civic software development and open data for cities across the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lesson for municipal leaders and advocates of open data became clear &#8211; make it easier for civic app developers in different cities to implement a new solution and it will quickly spread from city to city. The one significant impediment to possible wider implementation of Chicago Flu Shots last year was the lack of readily available data in more cities, and the lack of a consistent format for developers to use to more quickly implement it in their home town.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the most powerful aspects of civic software development is the potential for reuse of these applications in multiple cities that may face similar challenges, or where similar kinds of open data are available. This principle lies behind efforts like the <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Commons</a> and the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which is now active in over 30 cities in the U.S and international in Poland, Ireland and Japan. As with the Chicago Flu Shots app, one of the most significant impediments to realizing this potential is the availability of consistently formatted data across jurisdictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open data advocates can help foster the creation of civic apps that can be shared across cities by working toward the development of shared data standards and APIs. These shared standards can help make civic apps “plug and play” &#8211; cities that make the same data available in the same format can quickly and easily adopt civic apps built in other places. The Open311 specification is a great example of a data standard that has been adopted in multiple cities and helped to foster the creation of apps like the <a href="http://311labs.org/experiments/dailybrief">311 Daily Brief</a> and City if Bloomington, Indiana’s <a href="https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/uReport">uReport 311 app</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In response to the experience of last flu season, open data leaders in several large cities came together under the auspices of the Code for America <a href="http://peernetwork.in/">Peer Network</a> to develop a data specification for flu shot locations. Such a standard, it is believed, will help bolster the reuse of apps like Chicago Flu Shots that can be used to find nearby locations where flu vaccinations are dispensed, no matter which city you live in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/flu-shot-spec/">draft data specification</a> has since been developed to the point that it is ready for initial adoption, and several large cities including <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/tree/master/city-of-philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/developers/docs/flu-shot-clinic-locations-2013">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Health/San-Francisco-Department-of-Public-Health-Flu-Shot/acja-ak3a">San Francisco</a> are now using this data specification to make their flu slot location available for public use. The specification itself is on GitHub and is open for anyone to make suggestions for enhancements or changes &#8211; the goal is to continue to develop and refine this specification as it gets adopted in more cities and becomes more widely used by civic app developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hope in developing this data specification and implementing it in large cities is that it will foster the creation of new applications that raise awareness about the availability of flu shots and make it easier for people to find locations where shots are dispensed. The aim is nothing short of marshaling the growing army of civic hackers in cities across the country the to try and make this flu season less severe than the last.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether the 2013-2014 flu season will be as severe as the previous year remains to be seen. What we do know is that civic app developers in cities across the country will be better equipped than before the help mitigate the problem by leveraging a new standard for data on flu shot locations.</p>

		<p>Nothing in recent memory has focused attention on the need for wholesale reform of the government IT procurement system more than the troubled launch of <a href="http://healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/broken-car.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="broken-car" width="300" height="199" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;"></p>
<p>There has been a myriad of <a href="http://blog.dobt.co/post/63381111778/the-healthcare-gov-fiasco">blog posts</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexhoward/how-the-first-internet-president-produced-american-governmen">stories</a> and <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/politics/from-the-start-signs-of-trouble-at-health-portal.html">articles</a> written in the last few weeks detailing all of the problems that led to the ignominious launch of the website meant to allow people to sign up for health care coverage.</p>
<p>Though the details of this high profile flop are in the latest headlines, the <a href="../../../../2012/01/23/will-lack-of-procurement-reform-smother-civic-startups/index.html">underlying cause has been talked about many times before</a> &#8211; the process by which governments contract with outside parties to obtain IT services is broken.</p>
<p>The process clearly does not work well for governments &#8211; and many would argue that it does not work well for vendors either. Typical government procurement rules shut out many small firms that may be well positioned to execute on a government IT project but lack the organizational endurance to make it through the selection process.</p>
<p>What are the problems with the government procurement process and how can we fix them? How can we foster more participation in the procurement process by more firms that are qualified to do work? How can we lower the prices that governments pay for IT products and services and help ensure better quality? </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take on the major problems with the current system, and five recommendations for how we can start to fix them.</p>
<h4>The procurement process is too costly and complex</h4>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that it&#8217;s current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualities &#8211; no one would argue that these requirements are aimed at producing positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants. This is true, even if the positive outcomes desired are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for.</p>
<p>The added complexity borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion &#8211; in fact, much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms.</p>
<p>Requirements like <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Proposal+Bond">proposal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond">performance bonds</a>, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth) &#8211; to name just a few &#8211; are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they outsource work to a vendor. In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources.</p>
<p>However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesn&#8217;t seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of IT projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process. For example, many small firms argue that the bond industry doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to underwrite IT projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result &#8211; many smaller firms that may be well qualified to do work simply walk away from the process. This is true even of these provisions don&#8217;t lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of large IT projects.</p>
<p>Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>The use of these risk mitigation provisions at all levels of government helps highlight a more fundamental problem that is at the heart of the broken procurement process in government &#8211; a shocking <a href="../../../../2013/06/06/the-case-for-making-procurement-harder/index.html">lack of IT knowledge within government</a>. </p>
<p>A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large project &#8211; particularly IT projects &#8211; is to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully.</p>
<h4>The procurement process moves too slowly</h4>
<p>This is actually a fair criticism of government in general, but it is a particularly acute during the procurement process. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia the period between a contract award (a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of that contract (the beginning of actual work) can take an average of four months for some projects.</p>
<p>We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process &#8211; much of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._47">by design</a>. But long procurement and <a href="../../../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">budget cycles</a> can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that don&#8217;t provide a return for months on end.</p>
<p>There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and that all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to begin work.</p>
<p>An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can might to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.</p>
<h4>Some things we can do to make procurement better</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, here are &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement</strong></p>
<p>Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP (in the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process). In Philadelphia, we&#8217;ve had great success in using these smaller projects to test <a href="../../../../2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/index.html">new ideas and strategies</a> for partnering with IT vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.</p>
<p>Narrowing the focus of any enhanced thresholds for streamlined budding to web-based projects would help mitigate risk and foster a quicker process for testing new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Identify clear standards for projects</strong></p>
<p>Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic IT standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:5px;">
<li>The various components that a system will use.</li>
<li>The environment in which it will be housed.</li>
<li>The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;can go a long way to reduce the risk an uncertainly inherent in IT projects. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of IT standards that are usually made part of any IT solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date &#8211; they must undergo constant review and refinement. In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard. </p>
<p><strong>Require open source</strong></p>
<p>Requiring that IT projects be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.</p>
<p>In addition, government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source tools &#8211; leveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active community &#8211; to foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia">make the code behind their project open source</a>, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a more robust internal capacity for IT project management and implementation</strong></p>
<p>Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing and managing technology projects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.</p>
<p>Governments need to find ways to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities. </p>
<p><strong>Make contracting, lobbying and campaign contribution data public as open data</strong></p>
<p>One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the analysis of healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/">spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying</a>. It&#8217;s a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firms &#8211; who lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officials &#8211; to simply throw up their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-campaign-finance-data">contributions to political campaigns</a> is open.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all prospective participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possible &#8211; including small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices. </p>
<p>None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near term &#8211; these are items that I personally think are important and very achievable. </p>
<p>One thing that could help speed the adoption of these and other changes is the development of robust communication framework between government contracting and IT professionals in different cities and different states. I think a &#8220;Municipal Procurement Academy&#8221; could go a long way toward achieving this.</p>
<p>Look for more details on a Municipal Procurement Academy &#8211; to train state and local officials on best practices for IT procurement &#8211; in a future post.</p>

		<p>Philadelphia is unique among big cities in how it publishes open data for civic hackers, journalists, entrepreneurs, researchers and other users.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia has designated the community-built <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">Open Data Philly</a> website as it&#8217;s official data directory for open data &#8211; we&#8217;re the only big city in the country (maybe the only city period) that does not unilaterally control the data portal where city departments <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit#heading=h.luv2rrpp5h8d">publish their data</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.gov"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/shutdown.png?w=300&#038;h=183" alt="This website is shut down" width="300" height="183" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></a></p>
<p>Pursuing a strategy like this is <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2013/09/18/what-happens-to-opendataphilly-now/">not without its challenges</a>, but I believe that it is ultimately a better way to engage the community of users around open data releases. The members of our open data community are all stakeholders in the operation and management of the city&#8217;s open data portal. They can submit new data sources for inclusion in the portal, and they can <a href="https://github.com/azavea/Open-Data-Catalog/pulls">suggest changes</a> in how the platform works.</p>
<p>The federal government shutdown this week &#8211; which resulted in the federal open data site, <a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a>, going offiline &#8211; offers an object lesson in the benefits of community managed open data portals like those in Philadelphia, <a href="http://www.civicdataalliance.org/">Louisville</a>, <a href="http://opencolorado.org/">Colorado</a> and <a href="http://communitydata.io/organization">other places</a>. A government shutdown can&#8217;t impact sites that the government does not unilaterally control.</p>
<p>And this raises some interesting questions &#8211; can an open data initiative be truly open if the government that starts it can shut it down? What happens to an open data portal when municipal leaders that start open data initiatives leave office, are <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091500834.html">voted out</a> or are replaced by those that are less enlightened?</p>
<p>Some things to consider as we continue to build our community here in Philly.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>The Wall Street Journal recently featured <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324263404578613850076916028.html">an awesome story about civic hacking</a>, focusing on the amazing work being done in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the efforts of civic hackers and open data advocates covered in the mainstream press, and the team in Chicago &#8211; those both inside and outside of city government &#8211; deserve every bit of praise they get for their tremendous efforts. But I did take issue with one point made in the article &#8211; interestingly, one made in the very first sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Cash-strapped cities are turning to an unusual source to improve their online services on the cheap: helpful hackers, who use city data to create tools tracking everything from real-time subway delays to where to get a free flu shot near your home and information about a contentious school-closing plan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue the the fiscal pressure faced by governments &#8211; particularly cities &#8211; hasn&#8217;t helped encourage officials to experiment with new ways to provide services and information, and helped highlight the need for technology innovation. However, I don&#8217;t think its accurate to say that what is happening is an effort by governments to get IT work done by outsiders &#8220;on the cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about building things cheaper, its about building them better. </p>
<p>Implicit in the idea of &#8220;government as a platform&#8221; and the factors that help to drive municipal open data programs is that the <a href="../../../../2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/index.html">role of governments in the delivery of public services is changing</a> &#8211; toward the role of data steward or API manager, and away from the more traditional role of &#8220;app builder.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the role of data steward is a better one for governments &#8211; most importantly, governments don&#8217;t typically make good bets on technology. They&#8217;re <a href="../../../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">not set up to do it properly</a>, and as a result its not uncommon to see governments invest in technology that quickly becomes out of date and difficult to manage. This problem is particularly acute in relation to web-based services and applications &#8211; which outside civic technologists are very good at building &#8211; the landscape for developing these kinds of applications changes far too rapidly for governments to realistically stay current.</p>
<p>Governments that focus on becoming data stewards are better able to break out of the cycle of investing in technology that quickly becomes out of date. It is these governments that are <a href="http://phlapi.com/">moving to release open data and deploy APIs</a> to enable outside developers to build applications that can help deliver services and information to citizens. </p>
<p>However, this shift to the role of data steward doesn&#8217;t deobligate governments from investing in technology or skilled staff. It simply means that this investment can be focused within a role that governments are better structured to perform well. Developing the infrastructure and policies to support an open data program and API platform are not necessarily &#8220;cheaper&#8221; but they are a much better technology investment for governments to make.</p>
<p>In another sense, the move to the co-production of technology solutions with outside developers is also about building better applications as opposed to building cheaper ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common for those behind civic technology projects to have <a href="https://recovers.org/about">personal investment in the issues being addressed by their solutions</a>. These developers bring a different perspective to the problems that, in the past, may only have been addressed by governments &#8211; they are stakeholders in the success of our cities.</p>
<p>Engaging outside developers and marshaling the efforts of civic hackers to build new tools and new services to improve our communities is about enhancing the quality of solutions, and <strong>not</strong> lowering their cost. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the awareness of civic hacking and the open data efforts that fuel it getting coverage in the mainstream press. But we still have a ways to go on communicating the more fundamental changes to government this movement entails, and the real benefits we all stand to gain.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
Openness in government strengthens our democracy, promotes the delivery of efficient and effective services to the public, and contributes to economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Federal Executive Order on Open Data</a>, Section 1.
</p></blockquote>
<p>People in the open government community talk a lot about the potential and promise of open data. The things that it might enable. The problems it might help fix. The possibilities. </p>
<p>Each new instance where we see open data get used to address a problem facing a city or a community is a testament to its true power, and a validation of the work governments do to open it up and make it usable. When we see open data get put to use in the way that we envision it, it can be a very gratifying thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">new website in Philadelphia</a> focused on the challenge of unused vacant land demonstrates how open data is supposed to work. It&#8217;s built using a variety of <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/about/our-data/">data sources made available by the City of Philadelphia</a>, and it allows people to discover vacant land in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://thepossiblecity.com/lotxlot/">isn&#8217;t the first web site</a> to aggregate data on vacant land in Philadelphia, which underscores how <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2012/03/13/philadelphias-imminent-vacant-land-plan-major-progress-or-major-letdown">pressing an issue</a> it is for our city. One of the things I like most about the site is how it frames information about vacant land with an eye toward reuse. The site tells you the planing and zoning district a property is in, as well as the City Council district.</p>
<p>It tells you if there is a structure on the property by checking it against the city&#8217;s Stormwater Billing system, and if a user thinks it might be suitable to convert into a community garden there are <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/resources/">resources available</a> to assist.</p>
<p>Want to watch a specific property, or <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/organize/">organize neighbors</a> around it? Want to improve the data by <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/photos/add/">uploading a photo</a>, or indicating whether something is reported incorrectly? Want to purchase a property through a <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/pathways/sheriff-sale/">Sheriff Sale</a> or through an arrangement with a private owner? The site has information and resources to assist with all of these.</p>
<p>The site even hints at where the City of Philadelphia should go next with it&#8217;s open data efforts. One of the data sources used by the site is an <a href="http://api.phillyaddress.com/">independently built API</a> for property information. The data powering this API is actually scraped from the City&#8217;s website because it is not currently available as a data download or through a city-owned API. This is something we are currently working to change, but the fact that this site makes use of scraped data underscores the need for the City of Philadelphia to release this data in a more open format.</p>
<p>This site is everything that advocates of open data hope for when they work to make data more readily available and to provide <a href="http://phlapi.com/">documentation on how to use it</a>. What&#8217;s most interesting about it is that not once did the sponsors or developers interact with City IT staff while building it. Data that is truly open means that users don&#8217;t need to ask for permission before they use it, or for instructions on how to use it. </p>
<p>Open data works best when it is readily available for those that need it, to build useful services and apps that help address the challenges facing our communities.</p>
<p>This is the way that open data is supposed to work. </p>
