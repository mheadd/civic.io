<p class="graf graf--p">Famed management consultant Peter Drucker is often credited with the phrase “culture eats process (or strategy) for breakfast.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can’t change organizations by implementing new processes alone, so the thinking goes, you have to foster a new culture in order to drive real change. To understand the degree to which this idea is accepted as management philosophy gospel, we have but to count the number of times it is repeated at conferences, in meetings, or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/_jfeldman/status/1222660625794584576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a> by various thought leaders.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But when we think about changing the way public sector organizations work, particularly in how they acquire and manage new technology, this idea gets flipped. In the world of government technology, process eats culture for breakfast.</p>

<div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the great truisms that underlies much of the work being done by digital service teams in governments around the world, and in civic tech communities, is that governments are not very good at adopting or managing new technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of general disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly — technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">People working in and around government digital transformation often take the position that the disfunction they see in public sector technology adoption is the result of a lack of knowledge or awareness on how to do something “the right way.” As a result, a great deal of energy and effort is expended telling governments how to do things differently when it comes to technology adoption. We often seek to develop a new culture in government organizations — one that values the input of users, embraces smaller projects and more speedy deployment, and highlights the value of cross functional teams.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But what if we proceeded from the assumption that there are people in government who generally know that they need to change the way they do things, but are unable to do so. Framed this way, the challenge for those of us working in government digital transformation becomes less about telling people <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what </em>to do, and more about understanding the barriers keeping them from doing things differently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The challenges facing governments as it relates to technology adoption are quite specific — there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. More importantly, each of these processes that hinder efficient technology adoption work <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">as designed</em>. They are not broken. They exist for a reason.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these processes are, and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically. If we don’t these process will end up eating the new culture we hope to bring to government organizations, and the problems we hope to solve will go on.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile development are all cultural changes that digital service teams try to bring to their partners in government agencies. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/03/13/win-big-by-going-small/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Each underscores the value of “smallness”</a> — breaking work down into smaller pieces and delivering them more quickly. This reduces risk, and helps us ensure we are delivering services that will address real user needs. There is also ample data showing that larger technology projects <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/BigBangBoom.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fail at a much higher rate than smaller ones</a>.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It’s no secret that reduced project sizes and more rapid delivery to users improves project success rates, but why is it still so common to see large technology projects with long delivery timelines in government?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Let’s think about the processes that impact how a government technology project gets funded, approved, and implemented. these includes things like the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/federal-budget-process.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget process</a>, intergovernmental <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding and governance processes</a>, and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://atos.open-control.org/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accreditation process</a> for software applications.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Federal and state budget processes begin many months before a single dollar ever gets spent. As much as 18 months before a budget is even enacted, the executive branch will transmit instructions to agencies for preparing the future budget request. This will include a complex set of documents that will capture the amount of funding that agencies will request , as well as a detailed justification for why they need it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies will need these detailed justifications as the embark on a months-long set of hearings where their requests are questioned and scrutinized over and over again, first by the executive budget office and then later by legislative committees. Digital service teams often engage with agency partners after a budget has already been enacted, and the agency is ready to spend the money that has been approved. It’s not uncommon for these teams to find the agency’s plans for spending approved funds to be overly detailed and prescriptive, suffering from all of the symptoms of the Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) approach.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The success of a digital service teams’ efforts in working with an agency partner like this typically depends on whether they can instill the culture of “smallness,” by adopting approaches like modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile. Unwinding these plans for overly large technology projects, which fail more often than smaller ones, is not always successful. What’s often missed is that the budget process that makes funding for these projects available doesn’t just allow large projects to happen, it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">incentivizes</em> them. It makes larger projects more likely than smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies that can describe in detail to executive branch officials and legislators exactly how they will spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 18–24 months in advance are the ones that get their projects funded. BRUF is a virtue in the process in which budgets get formulated and adopted. It’s a process tailor made to encourage a waterfall approach to projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are similar effects from other processes central to how technology projects get funded and approved. The process that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governs how states receive funding for systems to administer federal programs</a> (e.g., Medicaid) have similar waterfall- inducing features. When these processes require states to develop large, detailed plans up front for funding approval, and impose burdensome gated reviews checkpoints during project execution, it makes larger (and more complex, and riskier) projects <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> likely.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is also true of the processes whereby software applications are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2017/volume-2/navigating-the-us-federal-government-agency-ato-process-for-it-security-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accredited and granted approval to operate</a> — a key milestone in many government technology projects. In some federal agencies, this process can take many months, or even years. The process usually requires many steps, lots of manual work and is paperwork-intensive.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because agencies face these burdensome processes at key approval points in a technology project’s lifecycle, it’s not hard to understand why larger projects are more common. From the perspective of the agencies that must comply with gated reviews and ATOs, it’s rational to decide on a project approach that minimizes exposure to these processes. If iterative delivery of smaller project components requires an agency to navigate these labor and time intensive processes more frequently, it helps us understand more clearly why larger projects are more common.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">In the early days of government digital service teams, the goal was to bring a new culture to government — one that approached risk differently, and placed the needs of users at the center of the work. A decade or so into this work it, seems more obvious than ever that simply bringing a new culture to government technology projects won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Simply telling agencies what they need to do misses the influence of existing processes — all working exactly as designed — on technology project outcomes. The need to reform these fundamental processes underscores that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://peknet.com/2020/02/15/digital-service-is-not-about-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our most important work is not about technology</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Either we work on fixing these processes, or they will continue to eat our agile culture for breakfast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

<p id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve had the opportunity recently to talk to people in several different city governments that are facing a common challenge — <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">how to liberate operational data from a legacy system</span>.</p>
<p id="fdb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a challenge that lots of city governments face, and it strikes me that there are some common lessons that can be derived from cities that have gone down this road already for those that are still trying to figure out the right approach.</p>
<p id="0867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following suggestions are crafted from my own experience as a municipal government official charged with making data more widely available, and those of people in similar positions that I’ve had a chance to speak with.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4739"></span></p>
<p id="538a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope this helps someone in a city government that is currently facing this challenge.</p>
<h3 id="a933" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem</h3>
<p id="08fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’ve got operational data in a legacy system that you want to make more easily available to users inside of (and outside of) your city government.</p>
<p id="8565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may be a part of a larger data or analytics strategy that is spinning up, or a one-off request from the Mayor or other political leader for a specific project. Regardless of how it landed in your lap, the job is yours now.</p>
<p id="9a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">You’ve got to figure out the best way to provide access to data in a legacy system in a way that is both useful for others and maintainable by you</span>.</p>
<h3 id="fde9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Some Hurdles You’ll Face</h3>
<p id="0982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You probably won’t have additional resources allocated to support this project, and if the system in question is a bespoke solution created by a vendor they may want to charge you a handsome sum to do the work for you.</p>
<p id="e88e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is one of the first projects you’re undertaking to get operational data out of a legacy system for other purposes, you may not have a lot of the policy and technology infrastructure in place to support what you want to do. In a way this is a good thing — you have a greenfield opportunity to help shape policy and set up infrastructure that can be used to support a broader data strategy for your city. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to figure out what you need to get the job done on your own. As issues or questions arise, It will be your job to figure out how to address them.</p>
<p id="ca37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, you’ll have to make some definite choices technology wise. The good news is there are lots of different options for liberating data in legacy systems, and many are low cost and leverage open source software. However, different solutions may require different levels of technical expertise — some or all of which may be absent from your current IT environment. You’ll need to figure out how to introduce some new tools to your environment and — hopefully — keep them aligned with the skill sets of your staff and consistent with established IT policies.</p>
<p id="f1a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With these challenges in mind, here is a description of one approach that cities are using to take data from a legacy system and make it more easily usable by people inside and outside city government.</p>
<h3 id="548b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Extract, Transform, Load</h3>
<p id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first step in liberating data from a legacy system is to make a copy of it.</p>
<p id="a382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This seems pretty straightforward but it’s worth emphasizing as you consider how to get started. The use of your data for analytics and other purposes should occur outside of the environment your legacy system is currently running in.</p>
<p id="7b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your goal here is to make a separate copy of your production data that is stored outside of the production system that is using it. You want this copy to be as close to identical to your production data as possible (with the caveat that there there may be data in your legacy system that is not appropriate to share, or that is unable to be shred because of existing policy). And since regular usage of your production system will cause your copy to become stale over time, you want to make the process of generating a copy repeatable at regular (preferable short) intervals.</p>
<p id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sequence of steps is generally referred to in the world of data management as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). It’s a common need and there are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to do it well. That said, it can be difficult to cut through the noise around ETL, sift through the competing options, and select an approach or solution that is affordable and maintainable. Additionally, for governments that have a heterogeneous technology environment with lots of different legacy systems, more than one ETL approach may be required.</p>
<p id="0e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluating the ETL lifecycle in reverse can be a helpful way work through the issues:</p>
<h4 id="7cb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Load</h4>
<p id="ab7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Where are you going to put your data once you get it out of your legacy system?</p>
<p id="38fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational database platform (RDBMS) of some flavor probably makes the most sense. You can use an RDBMS with a whole bunch of commercially available reporting tools, and an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://redash.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increasing</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/ankane/blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">number</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.cluvio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud-based</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> tools. You can also use it to build an API (more on this below).</p>
<p id="f75b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Already got a database environment and licenses? You’re probably good to go. If not, think about where you’re going to house your data (on a machine racked in your data center, or somewhere in the cloud) and select a database solution that is a good fit for your current IT environment and employee’s skill sets.</p>
<h4 id="6173" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transform</h4>
<p id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The amount of transformation you’ll need to do on your data before loading it will depend on the system it is coming from. If your legacy data is already in an RDBMS you might be able to skip over this step and simply replicate from your production database to a backup.</p>
<p id="647a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, particularly if your data is in an older legacy system, you may need to extract it into an intermediate format (e.g., CSV) and alter it before loading it into another database. This is almost always a pretty solid approach — there are lots of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tools</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/scripts/csvsql.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a> for managing and manipulating these kinds of files, and for loading them into an RDBMS. These tools are scriptable and can be automated, making them easy to drop into your ETL toolchain.</p>
<p id="41d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If extracts from your legacy system are initially going to be infrequent (once a month or once a week) then you may be able to work through this process manually at first. As extracts become more frequent, you can start automating it incrementally, with the goal of having regular, frequent extracts occurring in a completed automated way.</p>
<h4 id="c169" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extract</h4>
<p id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the part of the ETL process that you don’t get to choose. Your data is in the system that it’s in — your challenge is to get it out of that system in a way that won’t disrupt its current operation and that is maintainable by you and/or other city IT staff.</p>
<p id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your data is already in an RDBMS, then there are undoubtedly utilities available to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replicate</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sqlserverdump.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backup</a> data (hopefully you are already using them). You should evaluate these options to decide which is best given your current scenario.</p>
<p id="9240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It your data is in an older system like an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/industry_insiders/2008/10/01/sql-server-using-ssis-to-retrieve-data-from-as400/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AS/400</a> or a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3438/importing-mainframe-data-with-sql-server-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mainframe system</a>, you may need to create a custom solution for extracting data. If you have vendors supporting these systems, you can inquire about potential approaches and pricing. But keep in mind — these systems are pretty common in municipal government. Your counterparts in other local governments face this same challenge and some have already figured out how to do it efficiently. Communicating with other government IT officials might be one of your most effective mechanism for extracting data from older legacy systems.</p>
<p id="ef6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve identified an ETL approach that works for you, you will have a copy of your production data in a separate system that is now ready to use. Depending on who wants to use this data, and how they want to use it, you’ll have several options for what to do next.</p>
<h3 id="fbe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Making Use of Your Data</h3>
<p id="47a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Replicating production data so that people in operation and policy offices can run reports is a pretty common use case. If this was the driver for liberating your data from a legacy system, then most of what remains is simply pointing your reporting tool of choice at your newly created database.</p>
<p id="2d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if you want to enable other uses for your data — e.g., using it to support a custom dashboard or application — or if you’re not sure what all of the uses for your data will be — you have some more decisions to make.</p>
<p id="362b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option that you have is to put your data in an open data platform. If your data liberation work is part of a larger effort to make data more accessible to external users, you may already have one of these (or you may soon be getting one). If not, then you can still use an open data platform to house your data for use in internal reporting, analytics and application development. There are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/10/open-data-portal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots of commercial and open source options</a> that can be run both on premise and in the cloud.</p>
<p id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to create an API for your data. This will allow you to tailor the way that users can access the data in a way that most effectively matches their use case. This option will, however, require you to make some technology choices.</p>
<p id="78f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every modern programming language has frameworks for building APIs, and odds are that you’ve already got some APIs running in your current IT environment (even if you didn’t build them). If your IT organization is a Microsoft shop (which is pretty common in municipal government), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">there are</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">great</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">options</a> for you to use to build an API. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform provides some nice options for hosting your data or your API application, as well as for <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p id="1a3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluate the options that most closely align with your current environment and that are a good fit for the talents of your existing IT staff, because odds are they are the ones that will have to manage it going forward.</p>
<h3 id="dbc6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Comes Next?</h3>
<p id="ff5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Whether you’ve put your data in an open data portal or created a standalone API, you now have an interface that you can manage that allows people to access your data. There are a few things you’ll need to think about to manage it effectively in the long run:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="aa24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who gets to use your API? Will they be required to authenticate to use it, or provide a key with calls to your API?</li>
<li id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you open up access to your API to a select group of users (e.g., those on your internal network, or at a specific IP range) or will it be available more broadly, for anyone to use?</li>
<li id="8d13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you manage traffic to your API to prevent abuse or overuse by specific users?</li>
<li id="cd97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you monitor your API to ensure it is up and operating properly?</li>
<li id="170f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you log requests to your API and do regular diagnostics?</li>
</ul>
<p id="c71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond general management of your API, (whether you realize it or not) you’re also going to need to provide some support for users of your API:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Will you provide examples to users for how they can make calls and get data from your API?</li>
<li id="5586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who do users contact if they are having a problem using your API?</li>
<li id="8a6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where do users go to ask questions, or learn more about how to use your API?</li>
<li id="723f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will users (internal or external) be able to suggest changes or enhancements to your API?</li>
</ul>
<p id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot to consider for a project that you may not have explicitly chosen to undertake in the first place.</p>
<p id="657b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re working with a vendor that has provided an open data portal, many of the things listed above may be in place already. And your vendor will likely have experience working with other customers — when in doubt ask your vendor to provide you with examples of how other customers are addressing a common issue.</p>
<p id="259b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve built a custom API, here are a few tips to you get started thinking about the issues listed above:</p>
<h4 id="3bc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lend users a hand</h4>
<p id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provide users with enough information to get them started using your API without having the have a human help them. Your IT staff will thank you.</p>
<p id="42a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invest some time in creating user facing materials with examples of how to make calls to your API, and a list of frequently asked questions. The more information you provide up front that makes it easy for users to start using your API the less phone calls and emails you’ll need to respond to.</p>
<p id="11b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, set up a way for users to report issues — a shared email box that is checked regularly is a good way to get started.</p>
<p id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up a way to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.runscope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">monitor the uptime of your API</a> so you’ll know when it’s down. This will allow you to get it back up quickly and also <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communicate to users</a> that you are aware of the problem (again, resulting in fewer phone calls and emails).</p>
<h4 id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Treat your API like a shared resource</h4>
<p id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You should treat an API like a shared resource because that’s exactly what it is — improperly managed, one consumers overuse of this resource can crowd out the legitimate use of others.</p>
<p id="36d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requiring authentication for users is one way to keep track of who is using your API, and issuing API keys is another option. Keep in mind, though, that if users can’t sign up quickly and easily without human intervention, then your phone will start to ring (or your inbox will start to fill up).</p>
<p id="999e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should strongly consider a way to rate limit usage of your API — there are a number of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commercial</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://getkong.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> API tools that can help you do this. You should also give thought to a caching strategy to improve the performance of your API — this includes not only setting up a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proxy cache</a>but also sending the appropriate <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caching headers</a> with your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="1415" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Plan for the future</h4>
<p id="8630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As your API gets used, the people using it will form opinions about what they like and what they don’t like. Give them a way to provide this input to you in a way that you can refer back to. This will help you prioritize changes and enhancements to your API going forward and ensure you are directing your finite resources to the things your users want most.</p>
<p id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll also want to think about things like versioning your API to allow you to gracefully deprecate features and add new ones.</p>
<p id="d14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data APIs are increasingly common in government, and there are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/application-programming-interfaces-apis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> that can help you work through these issues.</p>
<p id="6c6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge of getting operational data from a legacy system and using it to support an internal analytics project, or an external open data effort are increasingly common in municipal government. You’ll face challenges in getting started, but you can take comfort in knowing that lots of other local government IT leaders are traveling this same road. Sharing your experience and asking others to share theirs is an effective way of working through these issues.</p>
<p id="f989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t let the fact that you don’t know everything keep you from doing the things you can do right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4723" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2017/02/14/read-my-book/book-picture/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" data-orig-size="592,398" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="book-picture" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=592" class=" size-full wp-image-4723 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=1000" alt="book-picture" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png 592w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"   /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p id="bcb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public sector employees that want to use data to improve how government operates, enhance the quality of public services or help governments make better decisions will need to employ a new set of skills.

<p id="0f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Its time for governments to reimagine their place in the civic technology production chain.

<p>The title of &#8220;Chief Data Officer&#8221; &#8211; once an uncommon one in state and municipal governments &#8211; is becoming less uncommon. And that’s a very good thing for public sector innovation.</p>
<p>As recently as a few years ago, Chief Data Officers were found almost exclusively in big city governments like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. Municipal governments provide services that touch citizens’ lives in more intimate ways than states or the federal government, and big cities have a critical mass of data that is attractive to the growing community of users with powerful tools for mapping and analyzing data. So it’s no surprise that <a href="http://publicsource.org/investigations/wolfs-plan-for-open-data-promising-pennsylvania-has-its-work-cut-out-for-it#.V7MwZZMrJ-V">cities have led the way</a> in creating new, data-focused positions like CDOs, and in releasing open data to the public.</p>
<p>But increasingly, state governments and small to midsized cities are <a href="http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html">appointing Chief Data Officers</a>, and creating new positions that focus almost exclusively on data. For example, earlier this year the City of Syracuse (a city of approximately 145,000 in Central New York) appointed <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/cdo">it’s very first Chief Data Officer</a>. It’s worth noting that this is not a stand alone position as in some other cities. The CDO position in Syracuse was deliberately made part of the city’s internal innovation team (which is funded through the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/">Bloomberg Philanthropies iTeam program</a>) and plays an integral part in the city’s efforts to use data internally to provide services more efficiently.</p>
<p><span id="more-4708"></span></p>
<p>In many ways, the newest cohort of Chief Data Officers being appointed in states and smaller cities highlights an important change in priorities for the CDO position, and for how governments view data as a part of their innovation efforts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opengovdata.org/">open data movement </a>&#8211; coordinated efforts to advocate for the release of data by governments in “open” formats &#8211; is an outgrowth of many earlier good government initiatives. The focus on transparency that was the hallmark of these early open data efforts largely informed the first cohort of Chief Data Officers in big cities like Chicago and Philadelphia. The first order of business for these newly appointed CDOs was the creation of <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/">public-facing web portals</a> that would allow external users to find and access government data. And while transparency remains a top priority of the open data movement, and building and expanding open data portals is still an important part a CDO’s work, the role of Chief Data Officer has started to evolve.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the focus of Chief Data Officers is on the internal use of data for more efficient resource allocation and improved operations. In other words, Chief Data Officers &#8211; once focused almost exclusively on making governments better <em>producers</em> of data &#8211; are increasingly focused on making governments better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>
<p>To some extent, this change in focus is born out of necessity. Governments at every level are under pressure to provide better service with limited resources. Data is a key element to streamlining operations and <a href="http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/municipal-analytics-the-startup-way-873">allocating scarce resources more efficiently</a>, and the tools and expertise for using data are becoming more attainable, even for smaller governments. But the more recent imperative for CDOs to enhance government operations using data and the original focus on government transparency are not mutually exclusive. In fact, these two areas of focus can complement each other, and help drive (and sustain) government innovation into the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic or organizational barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government &#8211; it’s not uncommon for one department to have difficulty obtaining data or information from another. Open data portals make data more discoverable – they obviate the need for special relationships, access or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use (including other government agencies), so fewer resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>When governments release data openly there are a number of very healthy incentives created by external data users. These users expect data to be complete, well documented and regularly updated – when this does not happen governments typically get quick feedback from unhappy users. Data that is regularly updated, well documented and otherwise easier to use has more value for every potential data user – including governments themselves.</p>
<p>So while the role of government Chief Data Officers is evolving, the traditional focus on transparency and sharing data with external users is still critical for governments to achieve their innovation goals.</p>
<p>A commitment to openness makes governments better <em>producers</em> of data, and better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In early 2012, I had the opportunity to present at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Conference in Austin, TX. The focus of my presentation was the</span><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093"><span style="font-weight:400;"> lessons learned from two civic hacking events</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in late 2011 that I had helped organize in Philadelphia and Baltimore.</span></p>
<p>This was an exciting time for me professionally. After leaving government to become a professional software developer and technology evangelist in the early 2000s, I had been drawn back into the world of government a few years prior through the open data movement. By 2011, I was working regularly with budding civic tech communities in two different but geographically close cities. I was able to collaborate with groups of people who cared deeply about the future of their cities and who were committed to making a difference.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was also an exciting time for civic tech—Code for America was launching its </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Brigade</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> network at the 2012 SXSWi conference and while there I had a chance to meet and talk with Jen Pahlka, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, and </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/kevin-curry"><span style="font-weight:400;">Kevin Curry</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (who went on to build out the Code for America Brigade program and scale it nationally). I was so moved by Jen’s vision for civic tech that I ended up leaving my job with a telecommunications startup and joined Code for America myself a few short weeks after SXSWi ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thinking back on this time, it strikes me that the experience of the two cities I got to talk about then can tell us a lot about what it takes to build and grow a civic tech community. I think it’s exciting that there are places where leaders have essentially </span><a href="http://civichall.org/civicist/toward-sustainability-for-local-tech-organizing/"><span style="font-weight:400;">figured out how to nurture and sustain civic tech</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would argue that there are many places where this issue has not yet been resolved, and even some places where civic tech groups once flourished by have have since </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/717364352500817920"><span style="font-weight:400;">gone dormant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Of interest to me personally, there are also a great many places—particularly small and mid-sized cities—where civic tech organizing has not yet begun.</p>
<p><span id="more-4646"></span></p>
<p><b>Then and Now</b></p>
<p>In many ways, Baltimore and Philadelphia were in similar places from a civic tech perspective in 2011.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The City of Baltimore had just launched an official </span><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and was regularly publishing data to it. A series of small(ish) </span><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/civic-hack-day-in-baltimore-tickets-1271496079"><span style="font-weight:400;">hackathons</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> were organized and there seemed to be a </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/baltimore-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">growing dialogue</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> between the local technology community and city government around data and civic technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At the same time, Philadelphia was in </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/philadelphia-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a similar place</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. The city had not yet adopted an open data policy or launched an official open data portal. Philly benefited from being one of the first cities to partner with Code for America and there seemed to be a growing acceptance inside city government for publishing data and generally supporting civic tech. Earlier that year, a local technology company called Azavea built and launched what would become the city’s official open data portal—</span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Open Data Philly</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And yet, if we look at these two cities today they appear to be in very different places with regard to civic tech. Philadelphia has a </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">large and active civic tech community</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with strong connections to city government—city officials are regular participants in civic tech events, and a recent civic hacking event was kicked off from City Hall </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/04/04/demhack-politicians-code-for-philly/"><span style="font-weight:400;">by the Mayor himself</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This community has helped spawn some of the most innovative civic tech solutions in the country, like </span><a href="https://www.councilmatic.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Councilmatic</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—which has since gone on to be adopted in other cities like Chicago and New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore, however, doesn’t have a clearly identifiable civic tech community—though there have been </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/"><span style="font-weight:400;">efforts to create one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. There are no regular meetups of people interested in working on civic issues, no regular events to bring the community together and grow it, no regular interactions between city officials and outside civic technologists. This is not because the city lacks passionate, talented people interested in working on civic tech. Far from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore has not been completely silent on the civic tech front since 2011. There have been a few events—like </span><a href="https://cityparksblog.org/tag/baltimore/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack the Parks</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—that started to build up the relationship between city government and the technology community. These events were largely due to the efforts of people like Andrew Hazlett and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Sharon_Paley"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sharon Paley</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (now with the </span><a href="http://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University). But the organization behind these events—the Greater Baltimore Technology Council—is now </span><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2014/02/24/gbtc-goes-on-hiatus-plans-to.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">defunct</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and no similar organization in Baltimore has moved to fill the role once played by the GBTC in leading civic tech organizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Digital Harbor Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, under the leadership by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewcoy"><span style="font-weight:400;">Andrew Coy</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—now at the White House, and one of the co-organizers of the civic hacking event in Baltimore I talked about at SXSW in 2012—has developed some pioneering youth technology initiatives in Baltimore. But these efforts seem to operate in a different space from the one we typically expect a civic tech community to occupy. In fact, they seem almost ideally positioned to act as a feeder program for a larger civic tech effort—bringing in young people with passion for their city and arming them with technical skills they can use to make a difference.</span></p>
<p>But that doesn’t seem to be happening largely because of the absence in Baltimore of an organized civic tech community that we typically see in other cities. There isn’t an organized community to feed these youngsters into that’s focused on using technology for the public good in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Both cities have an abundance of factors that I think are critical in helping develop a healthy civic technology community. They both face some pretty significant challenges, have developing startup communities and are full of talented, passionate people that want to work to make their city better. They also both have governments that at least publish some open data and have a formal policy around releasing data.</p>
<p>But beyond simply publishing data, there is at least one factor that is different—the level of involvement by city government in Philadelphia and Baltimore in their respective civic tech communities.</p>
<p><b>The Role of the City</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Writing about his work in supporting </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chi Hack Night</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—the wildly successful and influential civic hacking meetup in the City of Chicago—</span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/the-civicwhitaker-anthology-53351581"><span style="font-weight:400;">Christopher Whitaker</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> notes the important role played by city government in building the Chicago ecosystem:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of why we’re able to have as much impact as we do is because we have built a civic innovation ecosystem&#8230;each of these different parts compliments the other. The City of Chicago provides the data that powers the engine. The Chi Hack Night provides a place for talent and collaboration. The Smart Chicago Collaborative provides institutional support.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having city officials engaged and present at civic technology events is a key ingredient to their success, growth and longevity. As a former city official that was present at a lot of civic technology events in Philly my opinion on this issue is not unbiased. But this is a trend that is easy to spot in cities that have active civic tech communities like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/minervatweet/status/512024965294850048"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/messages/boards/thread/48563907"><span style="font-weight:400;">San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/05/19/predicting-food-inspection-outcomes-using-open-data.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/04/hackathon-in-boston-7-hubhacks-data-visualization-finalists/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/people/timwis"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>And if I had to point to one single factor that has stymied the growth of an organized civic tech community in Baltimore—a place with all of the other ingredients necessary for one to flourish—I would point to a lack of active involvement and support from city government.</p>
<p>And if this is right, then I think there are some important lessons here for supporters of civic technology.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There are lots of places where the issue of organizing and sustaining civic technology has not yet been resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Clearly there are places like Chicago where great strides have been made due to years of investment and institutional support. But there are many other places that have not yet started down the road of civic tech. And as is generally the case with support for open data, these places </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">tend to be small and mid-sized cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that lack institutions like Smart Chicago to support nascent civic tech efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The lessons from Philly and Baltimore also suggest that the progress we have seen in larger cities may be more fragile than we think it is. If direct and enthusiastic support from city government is essential to successfully organizing civic tech efforts, then what happens when that support goes away?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">New York City, under Mayor Bill deBlasio, and Philadelphia, under new Mayor Jim Kenney, suggest that a commitment from city government to open data and engagement with the civic tech community can survive the transition from one administration to the next. But I think it makes sense to consider what happens to civic tech communities when this commitment doesn’t survive that kind of transition, or evaporates for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In Madison, Wisconsin, an enthusiastic and growing civic tech community has </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">grown largely stagnant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> because of a lack of support from city government and hesitancy to release useful data. Derek Eder—one of the organizer of Chi Hack Night in Chicago—in talking about the struggles in the civic tech community in Madison, has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think the government, especially the city, deserves a lot of credit for helping start the community [in Chicago].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s right, and we shouldn’t forget this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Far from being a resolved issue, civic tech organizing in many places is still in its infancy. Rather than declaring victory, our work should now be focused on institutionalizing things that support civic tech so we can help ensure it survives going forward.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The big news recently in Philadelphia open data circles is the release of city employee salary information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For the first time ever, the City of Philadelphia will make public &#8211; in easily usable formats &#8211; salary information on every city employee, including elected officials. This data is now available for anyone to download freely from </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/employee-salaries-overtime"><span style="font-weight:400;">the city’s open data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and it will be updated quarterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">No doubt about it &#8211; this is a major victory for journalists, good government advocates and open data enthusiasts in Philadelphia. But it’s also a victory for everyone that lives or works in Philadelphia. A fuller discussion of why this benefits everyone may be a key to understanding how the tenure of the city’s new Mayor may differ from the last one, particularly with respect to how the new administration engages and interacts with the public.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p><b>High Value Data</b></p>
<p>Information on public employee salaries is typically one of the most requested data sets from a municipal government, and Philadelphia is no different. For years, journalism outlets (including Philadelphia Magazine) and others interested in analyzing how the city works have submitted Right to Know requests to the city for this information. Responding to these numerous requests for the same data year in and year out is a bespoke, burdensome process that consumes finite city resources.</p>
<p>In addition, the Right to Know process can be length and time consuming. This can create a strong disincentive to those that may want or need the data, but lack the time, resources or expertise to navigate the bureaucratic process to get it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Proactively releasing salary information as open data makes obvious sense from an efficiency standpoint.</span></p>
<p><b>How Open is Open</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Salary data is also widely viewed as a touchstone data set for any government that bills itself as “open.”  Under the previous administration, an open data policy was adopted in 2012 with the stated goal of “creating a high level of openness and transparency in government,” and yet there was resistance to proactively releasing a data set publicly which was highly requested and clearly fell under the Commonwealth&#8217;s </span><a href="http://openrecords.state.pa.us"><span style="font-weight:400;">Open Data Law</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p>Every other major city in the country already releases data of this kind routinely as a part of their open data program. Until now, the City of Philadelphia held the somewhat dubious distinction of being the only large city in the country with an open data and transparency policy not to publicly release salary data.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For the Kenney Administration to prioritize the release of this data just a few months after Inauguration Day sends a very clear and very strong signal that this Mayor’s idea of openness differs significantly from the last Mayor.</span></p>
<p><b>Who Cares About Data?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But beyond good government advocates, journalists and data geeks, why should anyone in Philadelphia care about city employee salary data? How does the release of this data affect the average Philadelphian who may never visit the city’s open data portal, doesn’t know what an API or an open data format is, and who has no interest in crunching data sets?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The significance of this data release for everyone in Philadelphia, and the clues it may hold for what a Kenney Mayoralty may look like, lie in the nature of the data itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Many of the data sets that populate government open data portals are relatively limited in their use. This is not meant to diminish their importance, or the value in releasing this kind of data, but typically what you see is what you get. For example, data on the locations of parks, playgrounds, infrastructure and city facilities &#8211; a staple of most open data portals &#8211; are almost always used simply to identify or facilitate travel to one of those locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">City employee salary and payroll information is different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like the release of </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/property-tax-balances"><span style="font-weight:400;">property tax balance data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that came just a few short days before the Kenney Administration began, salary data allows anyone to begin evaluating the quality of the job that the city is doing. Which departments have the largest share of city salaries? What employees, or departments are accumulating the most overtime?  How many unique job titles does the City of Philadelphia have, and how does this compare to other large cities? What is the salary range across job titles, and what drives the difference in salaries? Is the difference in salaries for the same job title too big?</span></p>
<p>This is just a small sampling of the questions that anyone can pose to the city using software they probably already have on their home or office computer. More than just a way of underscoring the importance of transparency, this data release feels like a signal that this Mayor wants to have a real conversation with the public where citizens are empowered to ask important (and sometimes tough) questions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Whether it&#8217;s enabling people to evaluate how the city manages its payroll, determining whether </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/01/12/tax-delinquents-permits-mark-headd/"><span style="font-weight:400;">permits and licenses are issued to tax delinquent properties</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> or even </span><a href="http://phor.net/apps/septa/"><span style="font-weight:400;">how often the trains run on time</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, this is a very different way of governing a city. This data release suggests that the new Mayor wants to have an open conversation with the public and is inviting their input into how the city operates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And that is something that everyone in Philadelphia can get excited about.</span></p>

<p>Tomorrow, the President will <a href="https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/surge-pricing-for-diapers-456df8b59c1f#.4na94p8kn">speak at SXSW and issue a call to action</a> for people inside and outside government to collaborate and solve the hard problems facing our country. This is a call to action that governors and mayors should echo &#8211; our communities are filled with people that want to help.</p>
<p>Reading about the <a href="https://jet.com/JetCares">Community Diaper Project</a> and other efforts to get affordable disposable diapers to low income families got me so excited about recruiting those from outside government to work on hard problems that I forgot I have <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/10/onboarding-civic-hackers/">written about this before</a>. I missed a lot in my first post.</p>
<p><span id="more-4497"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>We need to insist on collaboration not merely as an ideal, but as a basic design element for government&#8230;<br />
&#8212; <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Collaborative%20State%20-%20web.pdf">The Collaborative State</a>, 2007</p></blockquote>
<p>Collaboration is about so much more than connecting with just technologists and civic hackers (although that&#8217;s important too). But there are some <a href="https://opensource.com/government/13/6/five-elements-open-source-city">really important ideas</a> and lessons from the world of technology that can be applied to broader onboarding efforts.</p>
<p>We should study them closely.</p>
<p>Really good open source software projects make it easy for new people to join and start contributing. These projects are clear about their focus and objective, and provide detailed instructions on how people can become involved and the kinds of things they can provide. The very best projects make it clear how issues can be raised and clearly communicate to those that raise issues that their voices are being heard.</p>
<p>For most people that have worked in technology even for a little while, a good project like this is easy to spot. Prospective collaborators encounter very little friction.</p>
<p>Now consider the public &#8220;face&#8221; of government. This usually means an official government website, but it could also mean the primary municipal service building &#8211; its where people go to interact and transact with their government.</p>
<p>How collaborative do these official facades look? Do they reach out and invite those with the desire to help to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces/get-involved">get involved</a>? How hard do people have to look around for opportunities to apply their skills? If governments don&#8217;t ask, then they are missing a huge opportunity to not only engage more deeply with the people they serve but also to tap into <a href="https://medium.com/@bethnoveck/the-rise-of-the-citizen-expert-ffba66dea199#.m3uebcttn">expertise that is sitting dormant in their own communities</a>.</p>

<p>Good open source projects make it easy for new collaborators to join up and start contributing. Government should work like this too. Sadly, this is too infrequently the case.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change that.</p>

<p>Unshoveled sidewalks during the winter months are a persistent problem for cities in the snow belt.</p>
<p>For places with significant snowfall, unshoveled sidewalks pose a challenge to public safety and mobility for those that rely on walking (or public transit), and present an especially acute problem for those that have <a href="http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2016/02/wheelchair-users-disabled-weather-snow-storm/459855/">physical impairments</a>. Uncleared snowfall on other kinds of public infrastructure &#8211; like fire hydrants &#8211; also poses dangers for city residents and public safety workers.</p>
<p>This is a sometimes daunting issue for cities that government officials, community groups and civic technologists perennially struggle with. Over the past several years, a number of civic technology projects have been initiated with the goal of mitigating the problem of uncleared sidewalks and <a href="http://www.wkbw.com/news/five-minutes-of-shoveling-could-save-a-life">other public infrastructure</a> in cities. Few have been widely adopted, and &#8211; if we&#8217;re being honest &#8211; the impact of these efforts on reducing the problems associated with uncleared snowfall has been minimal.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of the problem seems relatively straightforward, and would appear to be a pretty good fit for a properly designed civic app. But despite several different efforts, there is not yet a widely adopted civic tech solution that most people would agree has had a meaningful impact on the problem.</p>
<p>In many ways, unshoveled sidewalks help highlight both the potential and the limitations of civic technology.  For those that care about civic tech, this issue is worth understanding more fully.</p>
<p><span id="more-4209"></span></p>
<p><strong>Civic Tech for Snow Removal</strong></p>
<p>One of the first civic apps developed by Code for America was <a href="http://www.adoptahydrant.org/">Adopt-a-Hydrant</a> for the City of Boston. The app created an easy way to volunteer to clear the area around a fire hydrant after a significant snowfall.</p>
<p>This app has since been deployed for other cities, and converted to support volunteers that want to help take care of other kinds of civic infrastructure like <a href="http://sirens.honolulu.gov/">tsunami sirens</a>, <a href="http://adoptadrainoakland.com/">water inlets</a> and sidewalks. In Chicago, the base Adopta-a-Hydrant app was repurposed and set up to allow volunteers to clear sidewalks after snow storms.</p>
<p>And though uncleared sidewalks are a persistent problem in the Windy City, the app <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">saw little adoption</a> and is now dormant.</p>
<p>While the group responsible for deploying Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">offered some criticisms of the app itself</a> to help explain its low adoption rate, it should be noted that when it was originally developed this app was pretty groundbreaking. And the basic idea of an app to allow citizens to volunteer to help maintain and clear civic infrastructure &#8211; which Adopta pioneered &#8211; is one of the more potent and durable ideas in the world of civic tech.</p>
<p>But an easy solution to help mitigate the perennial problem of blocked sidewalks and covered hydrants continues to elude those of us in the world of civic tech. And it&#8217;s not for a lack of trying. In addition to <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/adopt-a-sidewalk">Chicago&#8217;s Adopt-a-Sidewalk</a>, there are a number of other civic tech projects that have attempted to address this problem.</p>
<p>311 apps may let city dwellers report snow removal issues, and 211 services may let property owners in need of assistance find help if they need it. The civic tech company SeeClickFix operates a service call <a href="https://snowcrew.org/">Snow Crew</a> and at least two recent civic hacking events (one of which &#8211; in full disclosure &#8211; I am a judge for) have seen sidewalk snow removal <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/Snope-Mobile-App">apps</a> <a href="http://devpost.com/software/shoveler">developed</a>. There are even efforts to use <a href="https://twitter.com/unshoveled">traditional social media</a> as a way to call attention to the problem of uncleared walkways.</p>
<p>As a community, those in civic tech appear to have acknowledged that this is an issue worth solving. And if nothing else, web and mobile technologies have been shown to be pretty damn good at <a href="https://www.casseroleclub.com/">connecting those in need with volunteers that have the time or resources to help</a>. This should be a fixable problem, right?</p>
<p>And yet, every time the snow falls in non-trivial amounts in cities across the snow belt, the problems return.</p>
<p><strong>The Curious Case of Snow Removal</strong></p>
<p>In some ways, the problem of snow removal is unique in the context of allowing volunteers to help maintain civic infrastructure. As noted by the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> &#8211; which oversaw the deployment of Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago, the seasonality of the problem can make adoption difficult:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the application is useless when there is no snow on the ground. Adopt-a-sidewalk is irrelevant in the summertime, and, for most of the winter spent between snow storms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further muddying the water for potential volunteers, and unlike other kinds of public infrastructure, <a href="http://www.dsmic.org/documentstore/Plans%20and%20Studies%20(Corridor)/UMD-CSSAreaTransportationStudy/Snow%20Removal%20Ordinance%20Comparison.pdf">many cities in the snowbelt</a> require property owners to clear the sidewalks adjacent to their property or potentially incur fines. More than for other types of Adopta app uses, there is the potential for allowing people to volunteer to take care of infrastructure that they are already legally responsible for clearing.</p>
<p>Some cities in the snowbelt &#8211; but not all &#8211; may also provide sidewalk clearance services by <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936460">assessing a special fee</a> on property owners, by <a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/snow/shovel/index.htm">clearing problem sidewalks and billing those not in compliance</a> with local ordinances, or by <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/snow_corps.html">helping marshal volunteers</a> to help those in need.</p>
<p>But even in places where government is proactive about snow removal, the problems still exist. For example, the City of Rochester, New York has a service for clearing sidewalks of snow, but it doesn&#8217;t kick in until at least 4 inches have fallen. In addition, scheduling considerations can potential delay sidewalk clearing in different parts of the city depending on the nature of a particular storm.</p>
<p>Even a city like this one, that provides a service for clearing sidewalks and has decades of experience with contemporary snow removal practices <a href="http://reconnectrochester.org/blog/2015/03/finding-a-solution-for-sidewalk-clearing-in-rochester/">still regularly sees residents complain</a> of being negatively impacted by uncleared walkways and other public infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is a problem that neither the civic tech community nor governments seem to be able to develop a comprehensive solution for on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Toward Better Civic Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>For some types of civic tech solutions, the absence of a strong government partner isn&#8217;t a major issue. In fact, there are a number for which the very existence of an app can be tied to governments not being involved in a specific activity, or shirking their responsibility.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.detroitwaterproject.org/">Detroit Water Project</a> was started to assist residents who had their water service discontinued by the City of Detroit because of an inability to make payments. It was actions taken by the city itself that created the problem being addressed by this civic app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">Grounded in Philly</a> was started to help promote alternate uses for vacant property in Philadelphia &#8211; a persistent problem for which the city has been long been <a href="http://planphilly.com/series/abandoned-city">slow to respond</a>.</p>
<p>Both are examples of civic projects that address an acute need not currently being met by city government. In some ways, this approach has advantages &#8211; working with governments to get them to adopt, endorse or even to advertise civic apps can be a challenge.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project at a hackathon in Philadelphia to develop <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/08/24/philly-snap-hackathon/">an app for locating farmers markets and other outlets where fresh food could be purchased with SNAP benefits</a>. The official list of these locations is maintained by the City of Philadelphia, and the app was embraced by local non-profits working to make food available to SNAP recipients. But when asked if the city would help advertise the availability of the app, at no cost to the city itself, officials refused.</p>
<p>This kind of story is all too common in the world of civic tech.</p>
<p>To make a dent in the problem of unshoveled sidewalks and other public infrastructure, city officials and civic technologists are going to need to figure out ways to more effectively collaborate on solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>To be successful, civic apps will need to be accompanied by strong municipal policies (and enforcement of those policies) for unshoveled sidewalks and critical infrastructure. Civic apps can make up a part of the solution to this persistent problem, but probably not all of it. This may require working not only with executive branch agencies, but also with <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/syracuse_council_again_considers_50_fines_for_people_who_dont_shovel_sidewalks.html">city council members</a>.</p>
<p>Civic apps should probably be targeted to compliment existing municipal efforts where they exist &#8211; for example, in places like <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936460">Rochester</a> and <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/snow_corps.html">Chicago</a>, where some sidewalk snow removal assistance is already provided. Civic apps may also be valuable in helping raise awareness and ensure better compliance with existing municipal ordinances for clearing snow from sidewalks and fire hydrants.</p>
<p>Civic technologists can also help jurisdictions in the snow belt make better decisions on how to allocate limited snow removal resources. There is an abundance of data that can be used to better direct sidewalk snow clearing efforts like 311 data, locational data for schools, nursing homes, day care centers, bus stops and even data on vehicle registrations that can help identify elderly or handicapped individuals who may need more targeted assistance.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to not only help address a problem that is common in many cities in this country (and that disproportionately falls on those with fewer resources, a dependency on public transit and that are elderly or disabled), but also to expand our knowledge on how civic tech projects can become more collaborative with government partners.</p>
<p>If we can identify an approach that works, there is the real potential to gain valuable knowledge that can assist all kinds of civic tech projects.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t figured out yet how civic tech can mitigate the problem of uncleared sidewalks.
