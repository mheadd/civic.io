										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>

<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>

" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4774" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" alt="Delaware State Senate Chamber" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=2000 2000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /><p id="caption-attachment-4774" class="wp-caption-text">Delaware State Senate Chamber, Dover DE</p></div>
<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=1000" alt="should"   /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Designing simple systems is one of the great challenges of Government 2.0. It means the end of grand, feature-filled programs, and their replacement by minimal services extensible by others.</p>
<p>&#8212; Tim O’Reilly, <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html">Open Government</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The original idea of Government as a Platform is now almost a decade old. In the world of technology, that’s a long time.</p>
<p>In that time, people working inside and outside of government to implement this idea have learned a lot about what works well, and what does not. In addition, we’ve seen some significant changes in the world of technology over the past decade or so, and the way the we develop solutions (both <a href="http://www.buildwith.org/">in the world of civic tech</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">outside of it</a>) have changed fairly dramatically.</p>
<p>The power of the original idea for Government as a Platform continues to echo in the world of civic tech and open data. I have no doubt that it will for a long time to come.</p>
<p>But in 2015 what does Government as a Platform actually look like, and what should it look like going forward into the future? What are its component parts? How does it manifest in terms of actual infrastructure, both inside and outside government?</p>
<p>And, most importantly, who controls this infrastructure and has a say in how it is shaped and used.</p>
<p><span id="more-4006"></span></p>
<p><b>The Architecture of Government as a Platform</b></p>
<p>The idea of Government as a Platform &#8211; originally built on the idea of open government data &#8211; has become almost synonymous with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>APIs are <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">an important part</a> of how modern software is developed, and have been for some time. Building APIs, and the accompanying tools to use them, are at the core of what most governments aspire to put in place to support the development of civic apps. A number of different <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/">federal agencies</a> do this, as do large cities like <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/">New York</a>, <a href="http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/developer-resources/">Chicago</a>, <a href="http://phlapi.com/">Philadelphia</a> and others.</p>
<p>For many governments, the centerpiece of their efforts to support civic apps is an open data portal. Open data portals provide a central location for governments to publish data so that it may be more easily obtained by third parties wishing to use it. In addition, these data portals almost always provide some sort of API access to data &#8211; so by publishing data to an open data portal, governments are creating APIs for developers to start using that data to build civic apps.</p>
<p>An overview of how Government as a Platform typically manifests can be seen in the graphic below.</p>
<p><a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4008" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/gaap-1/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png" data-orig-size="1788,1257" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gaap-1" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Government as a Platform Today&lt;/p&gt;

<p>In this scenario, governments make APIs available to third parties for building civic apps. Governments may build <a href="http://phlapi.com/">custom APIs</a> for these third parties, or they may leverage the APIs that are <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/datastore.html#the-datastore-api">baked into their open data portals</a>. Alternatively, governments may choose to release the raw data that is used by third parties and civic tech actors to build their own APIs to power civic apps.</p>
<p>In general, this scenario sees governments acting as the stewards of data and APIs and empowering third parties to use these resources to build services which can be used by citizens to get information from government or to conduct transactions.</p>
<p>Third party civic app developers are consumers of data from government &#8211; either through a government managed API or by taking raw data from a government open data portal and creating their own APIs. The roles of data publisher and data consumer in this scenario are clearly defined.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the role of data publisher is a better one for governments – governments have historically not made good bets on technology. They’re <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">not set up to do it properly</a>, and as a result it&#8217;s not uncommon to see governments invest in technology that quickly becomes out of date and difficult to manage. This problem is particularly acute in relation to web-based services and applications – which outside civic technologists are very good at building – because the landscape for developing these kinds of applications changes far too rapidly for governments to realistically stay current.</p>
<p>There are also benefits for third party civic app developers in this scenario. As more and more governments open their data and deploy open data portals or custom APIs, civic app developers can build solutions that benefit not just one jurisdiction, but many others that may face a similar issue or need.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence to suggest that this approach is working. More and more governments are launching data portals and <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/">releasing open data</a>, and more and more groups of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">civic technology advocates</a> are coalescing around these platforms to build new civic technology solutions.</p>
<p>But we have enough experience with this model now to critically evaluate how well it works, and to determine if it will help realize the full potential of the civic technology movement.</p>
<p><b>What We’ve Learned So Far</b></p>
<p>I can think of three key takeaways from what can be described as the “first phase” of Government as a Platform. There may be more, but I think these are among the most important.</p>
<p><i>The line between data producers &amp; data consumers is fuzzy</i></p>
<p>The open data movement has its roots in the government transparency movement that came before it and gave it life. As a result, the traditional idea of &#8220;open government data&#8221; views governments as producers of data and outside actors (journalists, researchers, developers) as consumers of data.</p>
<p>But early on in the open data movement, it became apparent that <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/02/internal-benefits-of-external-data/">governments themselves stand to benefit greatly</a> from the process of releasing data in open formats. Opening data for external consumers means that anyone &#8211; inside or outside of government &#8211; can access it. The process of making open data available for external users makes it <a href="https://civic.io/2015/01/17/altitude-training-for-data/">more discoverable and more valuable</a> for internal data consumers.</p>
<p>Governments – big ones especially – are notoriously complex and stove-piped. Open data can help mitigate the impact of this organizational complexity, particularly if it is structured for easy use by outside developers as an API. As a result, governments themselves are becoming major consumers of the data they release on open data portals and through custom APIs.</p>
<p><i>Building APIs can be as challenging as building apps</i></p>
<p>For all the potential that open data and APIs may hold for governments the process of planning, developing, and maintaining big, expansive APIs <a href="https://civic.io/2012/03/21/to-api-or-not-to-api/">can be a challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The task of building and managing custom APIs often falls &#8211; for a variety of reasons &#8211; to a government’s central IT agency. Making one group within a government’s technology hierarchy responsible for custom API development and management can sometimes create issues. Proper stewardship of APIs often requires <a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/13/some-tips-on-api-stewardship/">specialized technical knowledge</a> and may also require specialized domain knowledge to understand the data that is being exposed through the API.</p>
<p>In addition, along with the new role of managing a production-grade API for external development, governments face the (still relatively new) challenge of <a href="https://civic.io/2013/09/17/the-lesson-of-pennapps/">building and managing developer communities around them</a>. Concentrating responsibility for all of this in one particular group within the broader government IT community can create a bottleneck.</p>
<p>And while this reality can make the out of the box APIs built into open data platforms more attractive, this option is essentially a “one size fits all” answer for the needs of data users. Most open data portals are not built to incentivize data standardization because the end goal is simply publishing &#8211; making the data available. This often leaves the hard work of cleaning and standardising government data to external users, or layers a <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html">SQL-like interface</a> on top of disparate data sets which can add complexity to civic apps and make them more brittle.</p>
<p><i>Building reusable civic apps is hard. </i></p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://www.citygram.org/">notable</a> <a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">examples</a> of civic apps that have been deployed in multiple cities. This is encouraging to see, and validates some of the original vision for Government as a Platform, but often this is the exception to the rule. Reuse &#8211; it turns out &#8211; is really hard.</p>
<p>There is significant <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/07/17/introducing-zoningcheck/">technical and administrative heterogeneity</a> between governments and this has made efforts to share open source applications like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505002240/http://civiccommons.org/">CivicCommons</a> and the earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Open_Code_Collaborative">Government Open Code Collaborative</a> much less successful than most proponents would have hoped.</p>
<p>It is becoming more broadly acknowledged in the world of technology that the once sacrosanct mantra of &#8220;build for reuse&#8221; might not actually make sense in every scenario. Building for reuse is <a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7#.60vib6z9f">difficult and expensive</a>. Some argue that developers should <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use">engineer for replacement</a> instead of reuse.</p>
<p>So knowing what we know now about the concept of Government as a Platform, how should we design the architecture of open data and civic technology for the future?</p>
<p>I am increasingly thinking that the answer &#8211; at least in part &#8211; is to think smaller.</p>
<p><b>What are Microservices?</b></p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
<p>&#8212; Martin Fowler, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Microservices is a term used to describe a specific architectural style for building software applications. In essence, a microservices approach envisions the building of an application as the process of assembling a number of different small, independently running services &#8211; each distinct from each other.</p>
<p>I find this approach to be particularly interesting in light of some other recent observations on how we build software &#8211; specifically, the “no stack” approach:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some characteristics [of no stack apps] is that they use other platforms and APIs (or protocols, in the case of SMS) to cobble together a service and in doing so rely almost wholly on those platforms and APIs for every function of the business other than the one they can be the best at.</p>
<p>&#8212; Andy Weissman, <a href="http://blog.aweissman.com/2015/05/no-stack-startups.html">The No Stack Startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The term microservices is particularly “buzzy” at the moment, and some people claim is just the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25501098/difference-between-microservices-architecture-and-soa">latest articulation of a much older concept</a> in the world of technology. Nevertheless, I think the idea of microservices holds enormous potential for the way that we build civic applications and addresses some of the key issues that have been encountered in the first phase of Government as a Platform.</p>
<p><b>Government as a Platform in a Microservices World</b></p>
<p>So what does the infrastructure of civic tech look like if we apply the principles of the microservice architectural style? Here is one way I believe it can look.</p>
<p><a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4010" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/gaap-2/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png" data-orig-size="1722,1280" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gaap-2" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Government as a Platform in a Microservices World&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=1000" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4010" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=1000&#038;h=743" alt="gaap-2" width="1000" height="743" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=1000&amp;h=743 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=150&amp;h=111 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=300&amp;h=223 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=768&amp;h=571 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png?w=1024&amp;h=761 1024w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-2.png 1722w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The centerpiece of this approach is not a government open data portal, but rather a centralized hub for routing requests and controlling access to different microservices &#8211; essentially, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>. Governments would manage this new civic tech infrastructure by managing access to different resources through this proxy.</p>
<p>Services would be compact and focused on doing one thing well. Because of this, the development and management of different services could be farmed out across the government IT footprint (and even out to the civic tech community). The central IT organization would no longer need to have concentrated expertise in both API management and domain knowledge in the data being exposed. Agencies outside the central IT agency would become full partners in building and maintaining the civic tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>Services can be created and consumed by both governments and third party civic app developers. Governments may deploy services for things like address verification and <a href="https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc">geocoding</a>, while civic tech companies might deploy services to <a href="http://zoning.io/">check zoning designations</a> and to do things as simple as <a href="https://parserator.datamade.us/usaddress">parsing an address</a>.</p>
<p>An area that seems particularly well suited for a microservice approach in the local government space is property data. Data on properties can span multiple agencies within a government and across multiple governments (e.g., city, county and state government). In Philadelphia, almost half a dozen different agencies maintain data on properties &#8211; the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/opa/Pages/default.aspx">Assessors Office</a>, the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/cityplanning/Pages/default.aspx">Planning Commission</a>, The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/Pages/default.aspx">Revenue Department</a>, The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/water/Pages/default.aspx">Water Department</a> and the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/li/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections</a>. In addition, there are non-City entities like the <a href="https://www.philadelphiaredevelopmentauthority.org/">Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority</a> and utility companies like the <a href="http://www.pgworks.com/">Philadelphia Gas Works</a>, Comcast and Verizon that all have information on properties in the city.</p>
<p>Each entity&#8217;s view of a property is through the lens of the service or oversight they are charged with. One property can have multiple representations in the systems of various different government offices and agencies.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where the Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections wants to issue a building permit or rental license to a property owner &#8211; a service for property tax balance could help them ensure that permits aren&#8217;t issued to owners with outstanding property tax bills.</p>
<p>Suppose the Revenue Department wants to set up a payment plan for a property owner with an outstanding tax liability &#8211; a service for gas utility payment would let them check if the owner is in arrears on other payments.</p>
<p>Consider a non-profit that wants to encourage urban gardening &#8211; a healthy collection of services around property data would make it easy to check for properties that are optimally zoned, contain enough permeable square footage to support a garden, determine if there are liens agains the property that might prevent such a use, and even to determine who the owner is so they can conduct outreach.</p>
<p>Microservices can make all of these activities simpler and more efficient.</p>
<blockquote><p>Government should only do what only government can do. If we’ve found a way of doing something that works, we should make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time. This means building platforms and registers others can build upon, providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core.</p>
<p>&#8212; Government Digital Service, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">Design Principles</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In instances where governments don’t build services themselves, or seek greater control than indirectly leveraging the efforts of civic technologists, they could use <a href="http://openprocure.us/">existing small dollar purchasing options</a> to contract for the development of new microservices.</p>
<p>Citizen-facing solutions would be built by government agencies as well as third party civic app developers. Civic apps would become simpler and more replaceable. With a reduced emphasis on engineering for reuse, developers could focus more directly on the needs of the people using civic apps. Interfaces can be tailored more efficiently and more cheaply based on our understanding of user needs or to respond to new policy imperatives.</p>
<p>This approach would better leverage both the internal (inside government) and external (civic tech) communities to deploy new services and make data more useful. A reduced emphasis on a homogenous technology foundation could make it easier to adopt new technologies as they emerge and reduce the risk of large scale system failures.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is what the future of civic tech looks like, but I do think its time we started talking about it.</p>
<p>Almost a decade on, a lot of work has been done to implement the idea of Government as a Platform, and we&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way. It&#8217;s time to put the hard won knowledge we&#8217;ve accumulated to date to work building the next phase of Government as a Platform.</p>
<p>Note &#8211; Eric Jackson, co founder of Democracy Apps, has written a <a href="http://democracyapps.us/some-thoughts-on-mark-headds-thinking-small-post/">thoughtful response to this post</a> with some great ideas for implementing the concept discussed here. Worth checking out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by a recent <a href="http://opencityapps.org/">Open City</a> project that repurposes data on <a href="http://istheresewageinthechicagoriver.com/">sewage in the Chicago River</a>, I wanted to work through a quick example of turing a web page that houses useful information on water quality in Philly into an API.</p>
<p>Here is a quick screencast showing how easy it is to take information rendered as part of a standard HTML page and turn it into a useful JSON API.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCa2DqJ3sh4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>It goes without saying that as more and more data producers in government learn about how data can be repurposed by others &#8211; both inside and outside of government &#8211; we&#8217;ll see more and more valuable information exposed as structured data and APIs. Viva #opendata!</p>
<p>Until then, there are some very powerful tools available for turing web content into powerful, reusable APIs. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every data wrangler has their own list of favorites &#8211; the go to tools that they use when they need to work with data. </p>
<p>If you need to clean, transform, or mashup data or if you are working with a data set that will form the basis for an application, here is a list of tools that can make life easier for you.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> &#8211; I don&#8217;t think there is a better tool for cleaning messy data than OpenRefine. One of my favorite features is the ability to <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Fetching-URLs-From-Web-Services">add new columns to a data set based on data in an external web service</a>.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> &#8211; I see a lot of JSON in my job, and its exceptionally easy to use JSON data with a tool like this one. For example, here is <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/6705590">a simple jq recipe</a> for extracting a list of licensed pawn shops in Philadelphia to a CSV file.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">csvkit</a> &#8211; CSV is another format I see almost everyday, and using csvkit makes it simple. My favorite utility &#8211; though I don&#8217;t use it often &#8211; is <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/csvsql.html">csvsql</a>. use this handy utility to generate SQL insert statements and easily create a relational database from a CSV file.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/toc.html">Unix shell</a> &#8211; jq and csvkit are both command line tools, and the Unix shell is the place where I spend a lot of time working with data. Without getting into a Windows vs. *nix war, there is simply no better collection of utilities for working with text files than those that can accessed via the shell. Tools like <a href="http://man.cx/curl">curl</a>, <a href="http://man.cx/grep">grep</a>, <a href="http://man.cx/sed">sed</a>, <a href="http://man.cx/awk">awk</a>, <a href="http://man.cx/cut">cut</a> and a host of others are enormously useful on their own, or in combination with tools like jq and csvkit.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:12px;"><a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> &#8211; pretty much the easiest way to create a web-based map from an open data set. There&#8217;s even <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/">an API for building apps</a> on top of the data you have in your CartoDB account. Enough said.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, my background is in software development so the list of favorites above probably reflects my own professional biases. Someone who works primarily as a data scientist might have a completely different list of favorite tools.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your favorite tool for working with data?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of attending a civic hacking event jointly organized by <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">Code for Philly</a> and <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia">Girl Develop It Philly</a>. The event had a tremendously good turnout &#8211; over 50 people by my count &#8211; making it one of the larger events Code for Philly has organized in recent months.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cfa_gdi.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="cfa_gdi" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>The mission of Girl Develop It is to empower women to learn software development, and as a result there were a good number of people at the event being introduced to civic hacking for the first time. This got me thinking about ways to onboard people new to civic hacking (and people new to coding) into civic technology projects.</p>
<p>None of these is new, but here are five ideas I came up with after the event:</p>
<p><strong>Data Liberation</strong> &#8211; the foundation of civic hacking project is open data, and far too much of the data civic hackers need is locked up in broken websites and unusable formats. Helping to <a href="http://pdfliberation.wordpress.com/">break some of this data free</a> can be a tremendous benefit to open data users and civic hacking projects.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong> &#8211; far too many open source and civic hacking projects go without proper documentation to help other developers contribute and to support end users. Helping to create or expand documentation for a project can be critical to helping it succeed.</p>
<p><strong>User Testing</strong> &#8211; Organizing and conducting end user testing for civic technology projects is sadly rare. There are some <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/introducing-the-cut-group-get-paid-to-test-civic-apps/">efforts underway to change this</a> but in order for civic hacking projects to improve and succeed we need real feedback from mainstream users.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach</strong> &#8211; One legitimate criticism of civic apps is that too few people know they exist. There are efforts working to change this, like <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/">Apps for Philly</a> (still in its infancy) &#8211; a site that lists a host of different civic technology apps that are available for users. Adding new projects to this listing (and others like it) will both help these projects succeed and give the person doing it a much clearer sense of the civic technology landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Helper Libraries</strong> &#8211; a great way to get comfortable writing code and to help out a civic technology project is to write <a href="http://phlapi.com/libraries.html">helper libraries</a> for projects with APIs. At the Apps for Philly <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/events/transit-2013">Transit Hackathon</a>, one project utilized recently released data from the City of Philadelphia on bicycle thefts. The lead developer created a <a href="http://bikethefts.jeffsbox.net/">new API for this data</a> to enable other projects to use it. Building new client libraries in a range of different languages would be a great way to support other developers that want to incorporate bike theft data into their projects, and to get some hands on experience writing code.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to contribute to open source projects and to help support civic hacking efforts &#8211; these are just a few.</p>
<p>We need more great events like the one organized by Code for Philly and Girl Develop it Philly to bring together all of the talented people we have in our city to work on these important projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I attended the most recent <a href="http://2013f.pennapps.com/">PennApps hackathon</a> &#8211; a biannual college hackathon in Philadelphia that has grown from somewhat humble beginnings a few years ago to one of the largest college hackathons in the world. </p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/pennapps.png?w=200&#038;h=225" alt="Penn Apps logo" title="Penn Apps logo" width="200" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Attendance at the event has swelled to over 1,000 participants from colleges across the country, as well as several international teams. I&#8217;ve been to PennApps 4-5 times in the past few years and it has been remarkable to see it grow. The last several I have attended, I brought with me colleagues from city government &#8211; some whom had never before been to a hackathon.</p>
<p>What hasn&#8217;t changed over the many installments of PennApps is the presentation of sponsor APIs at the kick off event. After a brief introduction by the organizers, the many technology companies that sponsor the event <a href="http://2013f.pennapps.com/apis.html">show their wares</a> to participants. This almost always involves a short description and demo of an <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> or <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym> that participants can use at the event to build something.</p>
<p>These presentations are witty, engaging and fun &#8211; they have to be. There are dozens of sponsors for the event and each is angling to encourage developers to use their tool or platform to build a working prototype by the end of the weekend. This is how companies built around APIs raise brand awareness. Increasingly, the process of building software has come to revolve around <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">leveraging third-party platforms and APIs</a>. This has changed that way that software development &#8211; particularly web development &#8211; happens, as well as the expectations of developers.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/venmo.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="Venmo makes their pitch at PennApps" title="Venmo makes their pitch at PennApps" width="225" height="300" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Most of the sponsors at an event like this one will offer some sort of additional incentive for developers that use their services &#8211; free credits, t-shirts, swag, etc. At a minimum, though, their services are easy to use and well documented. Those that are brave enough may even try a &#8220;live coding&#8221; demo &#8211; building a working application using their API or platform in just the few short minutes allotted to each sponsor presentation. When done successfully, this can help drive home the point to prospective users that a platform or API is easy to use.</p>
<p>Every time I attend this event with my colleagues from city government I say &#8211; &#8220;This is what governments need to do. We need to present ourselves to prospective users as if we were an API company. The same standards of quality should apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is increasingly common &#8211; and encouraging &#8211; to see governments publish developer portals. A number of different <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources#pages">federal agencies</a> do this, as do large cities like <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/">New York</a>, <a href="http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/developer-resources/">Chicago</a> and <a href="http://phlapi.com/">Philadelphia</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is &#8211; if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves &#8211; that most of them are not very good, particularly when compared with the offerings of private companies. Many don&#8217;t have common elements like an <a href="http://developer.washingtonpost.com/docs/services/144/operations/833/console">API console</a>, <a href="http://pusher.com/tutorials">code samples &amp; tutorials</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries">helper libraries</a> or a <a href="http://www.tokbox.com/forums/">discussion forum</a>.</p>
<p>If we want to encourage developers to use open government data we need to be realistic with ourselves about what  developers have come to expect in terms of an API offering. Events like PennApps have raised the bar for anyone that wants to encourage developers to build useful and interesting applications with their data and APIs &#8211; governments included.</p>
<p>We must enhance the quality of government developer portals, and we must work harder (and faster) to develop <a href="https://civic.io/2013/02/26/on-data-standards-for-cities/">shared standards</a> for government data and APIs. Most importantly, we have to do more to share tips, tricks and best practices between governments. There are <a href="https://github.com/project-open-data/slash_developer">some</a> <a href="http://dev.socrata.com/">tools</a> out there to get governments started down the road of building a developer center that is impactful and engaging, but we must do more.</p>
<p>Developer centers are not just a mandate or requirement that we need to check of our &#8220;to do&#8221; list. Government developer portals should be the hubs around which we engage and communicate with developers, technologists and the broader data community.</p>
<p>In a subsequent post, I&#8217;ll share a checklist that I&#8217;m putting together with a list of basic elements that every government developer portal should have. </p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a great weekend for civic hacking.</p>
<p>Daylight Savings Time has given us an extra hour, advances in telephony application development have made it dead simple to build text messaging applications and Google has given us the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Civic Information API</a>.</p>
<p>With an election on Tuesday, I wanted to build a quick application that demonstrated the ease with which SMS apps can be built and the power of Google&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>The address of a polling place is both valuable and succinct &#8211; it&#8217;s the ideal kind of information to deliver through multiple communication channels. Text messaging (SMS) is a fairly ubiquitous communication channel, and in some cities &#8211; like Philadelphia &#8211; it&#8217;s an important way to engage with citizens that may face barriers to digital access.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIQSKihBJcg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>The screencast above demonstrates how to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/4008408">the script I developed</a> using the Google Civic Information API and the <a href="https://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a> telephony platform.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this, and there are a <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=SMS">large number of text messaging platforms and services</a> to choose from, so if you want to use your extra hour this weekend to help people find their polling location pick the one you like best and get cracking.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never been easier to build useful communication and messaging apps &#8211; in fact it&#8217;s getting easier every day. And with the richness of information available through APIs like Google&#8217;s Civic Information API, it&#8217;s never been easier to build an app that will help people get to their polling location.</p>
<p>Election day is just around the corner. Use your extra hour this weekend wisely&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Really excited to launch a new OpenGov project in Philadelphia &#8211; <a href="http://phinditfor.me/">Phind It For Me</a>.</p>
<p>The service is built on <a href="http://phlapi.com">PHLAPI</a> and the point data sets it houses.  As such, one could understand why I&#8217;d be interested in <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2334">enhancing the data sets currently in PHLAPI</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this project &#8211; source code <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/finditforme">available on GitHub</a> &#8211; and would love to see if there is an interest in launching in other cities with CouchDB-based geospatial data repositories, like <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2234">Baltimore</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s built on the awesome new <a href="http://smsified.com/">SMSified platform</a> from Voxeo (disclaimer, I work there) and uses a Node.js module I built for <a href="http://blog.smsified.com/2011/05/introducing-the-smsified-node-js-module/">working with the SMSified API</a>.</p>
<p>As always, dear readers, any comments or feedback is welcomed.</p>
<p>Do head on over to the <a href="http://phinditfor.me/">project website</a> and check it out! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of my open gov energy of late has been focused on replicating a technique pioneered by <a href="http://twitter.com/maxogden">Max Ogden</a> (creator of <a href="http://pdxapi.com/">PDXAPI</a>) to convert geographic information in shapefile format into an easy to use format for developers.</p>
<p>Specifically, Max has pioneered a technique for converting shapefiles into documents in an instance of <a href="https://github.com/vmx/couchdb">GeoCouch</a> (the geographic -enabled version of <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>).</p>
<p>I was thrilled recently to come across <a href="http://bniajfi.org/map_gallery/gis_shapefiles">some data for the City of Baltimore</a> and since I know there are some open government developments in the works there, I decided to put together a quick screencast showing how open data &#8211; when provided in an easily used format &#8211; can form the basis for some pretty useful civic applications.</p>
<p>The screencast below walks through a quick demonstration of <a href="https://gist.github.com/790499">an application I wrote in PHP</a> to run on the <a href="https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp">Tropo</a> platform &#8211; it currently supports SMS, IM and Twitter use.  </p>
<p>Just send an address in the City of Baltimore to one of the following user accounts along with a hashtag for the type of location you are looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>SMS: <strong>(410) 205-4503</strong></li>
<li>Jabber / Gtalk: <strong>bmorelocal@tropo.im</strong> </li>
<li>Twitter: <strong>@baltimoreAPI</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This demo application interacts with a GeoCouch instance I have running in Amazon EC2 &#8211; you can take a look at the data I populated it with by going to <a href="http://voiceingov.iriscouch.com/">baltapi.com</a> and accessing the standard CouchDB user interface.  I haven&#8217;t really locked this instance down all that tight, but there really isn&#8217;t anything in it that I can&#8217;t replace.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.voiceingov.org/blog/wp-content/bl-sms-296x300.jpg" alt="Locate places in Baltimore via SMS" title="Locate places in Baltimore via SMS" width="296" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2290" /></p>
<p>Besides, one of the nice things about this technique is how easy it is to convert data from shapefile format and populate a GeoCouch instance.  Hopefully others with GIS datasets will look at this approach as a viable one for providing data to developers.  (If anyone has some shapefiles for the City of Baltimore and you want to share them, let me know and I&#8217;ll load them into <a href="http://voiceingov.iriscouch.com/">baltapi.com</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of people in Baltimore pushing for an open data program from their city government, and I have heard that there are some really cool things in the pipeline.  I can&#8217;t wait to see how things develop there, and I want to do anything I can to help.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this simple demo will be useful in illustrating both the ease with which data can be shared with developers and the potential benefit that applications built on top of open data can hold for municipalities.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (4/18/2011):</strong> I&#8217;ve actually replicated all of the Baltimore data from the EC2 instance discussed in this blog post to the new <a href="http://www.iriscouch.com/">Iris Couch</a> instance.  Iris Couch is by far the easiest way to get started using CouchDB, and Couch&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Replication">replication</a> feature makes it easy to move data into an Iris Couch instance.</p>
