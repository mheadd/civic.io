										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, April 28th, the 2nd Philly Tech Week came to a close. </p>
<p>Like the inaugural Philly Tech Week last year, this weeklong series of technology events and panels concluded with a hackathon focused on open government data and journalism.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/hackathon-sign.jpg?w=240&#038;h=320" alt="This way to the hackathon" title="This way to the hackathon" width="240" height="320" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>I gave a brief preview of this event over <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/04/30/building-the-new-civic-hackathon/">on the Code for America blog</a>, and shared some observations on how I thought this event was pushing the boundaries of what the &#8220;traditional&#8221; notion of a hackathon is:</p>
<p>This event &#8211; which took place in conjunction with <a href="http://bcniphilly.com/">BarCamp News Innovation</a> &#8211; was a mashup of journalism unconference and open data hackathon. More clearly than most events, this one underscored the important relationships between civic hackers and journalists, and the common interest they both have in open government data.</p>
<p>In my mind, this event also highlights the maturity of the open data and civic hacking cultures in Philadelphia &#8211; the only city to date to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012-partners/philadelphia/">partner with Code for America for two years in a row</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2536"></span></p>
<p>The turnout at the event was awesome &#8211; a large crowd of participants gathered in a set of adjoining TV studios at Annenberg Hall on the Campus of Temple University. The crowd included developer, designers, journalists, data experts and other interested parties.</p>
<p>The sheer number of people at this year&#8217;s event far surpassed last year &#8211; a testament to the growing interest in open data in Philly, and <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/30/practical-hackathons-free-is-not-always-better/">new strategies</a> for attracting an optimal number of hackathon participants.</p>
<p>One of the overarching themes of Philly Tech Week was digital inclusion &#8211; it has been widely stated that <a href="http://www.phillykeyspots.org/">approximately 41 percent of Philadelphia residents</a> lack access to the Internet.  To ensure a focus on this issue at the hackathon, the <a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/">Center for Public Interest Journalism</a>, housed at Temple University, pledged $3,000 in prizes for the best mobile-focused projects.</p>
<p>As a result, 1/2 a dozen viable projects were demoed at the end of the day, most of them with a mobile access focus.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://textblast.org/">TextBlast</a> &#8211; a community organizing tool based around SMS messaging.</li>
<li>Dispatch &#8211; an organizing and survey tool for taxi drivers that uses SMS messaging.</li>
<li><a href="http://lgbtrights.me/">LGBT Rights</a> &#8211; a mobile web application to matches a user&#8217;s location with information on their LGBT rights.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">CouncilMatic</a> &#8211; a web site that allows users to subscribe to information about matters before city council.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cpijournalism.org/money-talks/">Money Talks</a> &#8211; a web site that will allow detailed analysis of campaign finance reports.</li>
<li><a href="http://sheltr.org/">Sheltr</a> &#8211; an SMS and iPhone interface for the RHoK hackathon-born Sheltr project.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, some of the more powerful takeaways from this event were the diversity of the teams and the focus on previous hackathon projects.</p>
<p>The Money Talks team had a median age that was north of what is typically seen at civic hacking events; The LGBT Rights team included a journalist from the Philly Gay News; the Dispatch team decided on their project focus after hearing from a Philly taxi driver during the morning pitch session.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/hacking.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="Teams hacking at the BCNI hackathon" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>In addition, several of the project &#8211; TextBlast and CouncilMatic &#8211; were born at previous hackathons.  Their creators used this past weekend as a sort of code sprint to further develop their projects and add new features.</p>
<p>The eventual winner of the event was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ahinz">Adam Hinz</a>, who worked on adding an SMS interface and a native iPhone app for the Sheltr project. Sheltr is a project that came out of a <a href="http://www.rhok.org/event/philadelphia-pa-usa">Random Hacks of Kindness event in Philadelphia</a> several months ago.</p>
<p>This underscores how hackathons in Philly &#8211; and elsewhere &#8211; are growing beyond the simple weekend project that gets forgotten after the adrenaline from the event wears off. The hackers behind these projects are continuing to develop them, and are using subsequent hacking events as an opportunity to recruit new talent or add new features.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&#8217;ll continue to see these trends at future events in Philly, and across the country.</p>
<p>More photos from the event are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/markheadd/sets/72157629569197794/with/6982535944/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ordinary telephone is among the most important and ubiquitous technologies in the world.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://www.flyingkitemedia.com/features/incitexchange0221.aspx">inciteXchange</a> &#8211; an annual conference organized by the Center for Design and Innovation at Temple University&#8217;s Fox School of Business. The focus of the event was to bring together speakers on a diverse range of topics to present short talks aimed at inciting collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>I gave a talk at this event entitled &#8220;Phone City,&#8221; which underscored the importance of telephones and mobile devices to our everyday lives, and &#8211; I believe &#8211; to the future of our cities.</p>
<p><span id="more-2442"></span></p>
<p><strong>A healthy obsession</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with phones.</p>
<p>Toward the end of my time in state government, about 9 years ago, I helped initiate a project that used previous generation cell phones and standard household phones to help people without Internet access <a href="http://dti.delaware.gov/services/accessloc.shtml">find a public access point</a> (usually a public library) close by.</p>
<p>The project went on to win a national award, and is still active today &#8211; but that&#8217;s not what I think is most notable about this small project begun almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that as we develop increasingly sophisticated tools for people to connect to, interact with, and get services from governments, we continue to struggle with the seemingly intractable problem of the digital divide.  </p>
<p>And despite all the changes in technology we&#8217;ve seen over the last decade, we still rely on the humble telephone in our quest to bridge this divide.</p>
<p><strong>Surrounded by phones</strong></p>
<p>The penetration rate for mobile phones is <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Mobile-Access-2010/Part-2/Internet-use-and-data-applications-using-mobile-phones.aspx">better than 80 percent</a>, while in some cities (like Philadelphia) traditional access to the Internet can be <a href="http://www.phillykeyspots.org/about-us">as low as 60 percent</a>.</p>
<p>And while Internet use on mobile devices is rising, for some services provided by governments and non-profits, having access to a mobile device is an inadequate replacement for traditional internet access. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/Media-Mentions/2011/For-minorities-new-digital-divide-seen.aspx">It&#8217;s been noted before</a> how certain activities, like filing out a job application, filing for unemployment or paying taxes are simply not practical tasks when using a cell phone, regardless of how advanced it is.</p>
<p>However, one of the things that mobile devices are very good for is determining a user&#8217;s location &#8211; this is true both of newer smart phones and (increasingly) older feature phones, using both voice and SMS interfaces.</p>
<p>In light of these factors, phones are an ideal &#8220;bridging&#8221; technology for getting people who don&#8217;t have access to traditional internet devices in their home or at work to a location nearby that does.</p>
<p><strong>Variations on a theme</strong></p>
<p>It comes as no surprise then that we see an abundance of useful applications built for telephones that direct us to all sorts of locations of interest.  And I&#8217;m not just referring to smartphone apps that leverage the geolocation features of more modern phones.</p>
<p>Increasingly apps like <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=snapfresh">SNAPFresh</a>, <a href="http://www.appsformetrochicago.org/apps/techno-finder-0">TechnoFinder</a> and <a href="http://timwis.com/2011/06/phillyvoter/">PhillyVoter</a> to name just a few are using the ubiquity of SMS to provide location information to users, directing them to retailers that accept SNAP benefits, locations in their neighborhoods with free Internet access and polling places.</p>
<p>These applications are the building blocks of the bridge over the digital divide. </p>
<p>Phones have always played an important part in how we communicate with each other, and with our governments. As the cost of telephony services continues to erode, and as the tools for building phone-based apps become more widespread and more powerful, we are bound to see more innovative uses of this very common technology.</p>
<p>Phones are the key to our cities. </p>
<p>Government leaders and civic developers would be wise to consider the long and productive history that phones have played in connecting people to the places of importance to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Really excited to launch a new OpenGov project in Philadelphia &#8211; <a href="http://phinditfor.me/">Phind It For Me</a>.</p>
<p>The service is built on <a href="http://phlapi.com">PHLAPI</a> and the point data sets it houses.  As such, one could understand why I&#8217;d be interested in <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2334">enhancing the data sets currently in PHLAPI</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this project &#8211; source code <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/finditforme">available on GitHub</a> &#8211; and would love to see if there is an interest in launching in other cities with CouchDB-based geospatial data repositories, like <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=2234">Baltimore</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s built on the awesome new <a href="http://smsified.com/">SMSified platform</a> from Voxeo (disclaimer, I work there) and uses a Node.js module I built for <a href="http://blog.smsified.com/2011/05/introducing-the-smsified-node-js-module/">working with the SMSified API</a>.</p>
<p>As always, dear readers, any comments or feedback is welcomed.</p>
<p>Do head on over to the <a href="http://phinditfor.me/">project website</a> and check it out! </p>
