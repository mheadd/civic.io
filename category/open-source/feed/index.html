<p>The centerpiece of any government open data effort is usually a data portal.</p>
<p>Data portals host open data or provide listings for datasets, and typically include things like license information, data schemas, developer documentation and a host of other details aimed at making it easier for end consumers to find and use data. There is a great deal of variation in the degree to which government data portals succeed in making it easier for people to find and use data &#8211; some do it very well, others do not.</p>
<p>In some ways, an open data portal can simultaneously represent all that is right with a government open data program &#8211; all the potential it has for changing the way government works and how people interact with their government &#8211; as well as all of its limitations. </p>
<p>I am <a href="https://civic.io/2015/04/01/i-hate-open-data-portals/">not unbiased</a> in this opinion.</p>
<p><span id="more-4552"></span></p>
<p>Recently, we&#8217;ve seen some really good examples of what an open data portal can be &#8211; chief among them is the recently launched <a href="http://datausa.io/">DataUSA</a> site. This site does an amazing job of making data more discoverable and more accessible for those without data science and developer skill sets. One of the people behind the site &#8211; <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/hidalgo">César A. Hidalgo</a> of MIT &#8211; wrote about the design approach used for the site <a href="http://datausa.io/">here</a>. It&#8217;s an important read.</p>
<p>Making data more consumable and more actionable is clearly an important goal of any open data program. Employing good design in building data visualization options and tools is obviously a big step forward, and much more work needs to be done on this front to help mainstream users find insights in government data.</p>
<p>But if we think about the ways that we might make data more usable and more actionable it makes sense to think about governments as the creator of these richer, more compelling visualizations versus government as the enabler of them. </p>
<p>If the data in government open data portals isn&#8217;t presented in a format that is easy to use and easy to draw conclusions from by non-technical users, how do we fix that? Is it the job of government itself to create these new views and uses of data, or are there <a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/717715634226860033">intermediary actors</a> that governments can rally to this effort? Where do these new uses of data live &#8211; on an external site, or within the portal proper?</p>
<p>And beyond this, how then do we quantify the impact or success of an open data portal? Is it on the number (or event the quality) of data sets published? Or should we base success on how data is ultimately used by data consumers? Is a data portal just the data that lives on the portal site, or is it the sum of all of the maps, apps and visualizations that use data from a portal?</p>
<p>More than anything else, the success of an open data portal rests with its ability to marshal the efforts of those outside government. Publishing open data is not exclusively about presenting a finished product accessible to any end user, but rather it is an invitation to a (hopefully) active community of users that should articulate to government which data sets they believe are most relevant and to inform the creation of data visualizations and apps that are most important to them.</p>
<p>There is clearly room to <a href="http://chriswhong.com/open-data/thoughts-on-open-data-part-1/">make open data portals better</a> and <a href="https://wpopendata.org/">more cost effective</a>. But as we surface ideas and approaches for doing this, we should not lose sight of the fact that &#8211; first and foremost &#8211; an open data portal must sit at the center of an outreach and engagement effort.</p>
<p>When we start to view open data portals not as a static end destination for users, but rather as an important part of making the journey to a more engaged and informed community, we&#8217;ll see them really change for the better.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, the President will <a href="https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/surge-pricing-for-diapers-456df8b59c1f#.4na94p8kn">speak at SXSW and issue a call to action</a> for people inside and outside government to collaborate and solve the hard problems facing our country. This is a call to action that governors and mayors should echo &#8211; our communities are filled with people that want to help.</p>
<p>Reading about the <a href="https://jet.com/JetCares">Community Diaper Project</a> and other efforts to get affordable disposable diapers to low income families got me so excited about recruiting those from outside government to work on hard problems that I forgot I have <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/10/onboarding-civic-hackers/">written about this before</a>. I missed a lot in my first post.</p>
<p><span id="more-4497"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>We need to insist on collaboration not merely as an ideal, but as a basic design element for government&#8230;<br />
&#8212; <a href="http://www.demos.co.uk/files/Collaborative%20State%20-%20web.pdf">The Collaborative State</a>, 2007</p></blockquote>
<p>Collaboration is about so much more than connecting with just technologists and civic hackers (although that&#8217;s important too). But there are some <a href="https://opensource.com/government/13/6/five-elements-open-source-city">really important ideas</a> and lessons from the world of technology that can be applied to broader onboarding efforts.</p>
<p>We should study them closely.</p>
<p>Really good open source software projects make it easy for new people to join and start contributing. These projects are clear about their focus and objective, and provide detailed instructions on how people can become involved and the kinds of things they can provide. The very best projects make it clear how issues can be raised and clearly communicate to those that raise issues that their voices are being heard.</p>
<p>For most people that have worked in technology even for a little while, a good project like this is easy to spot. Prospective collaborators encounter very little friction.</p>
<p>Now consider the public &#8220;face&#8221; of government. This usually means an official government website, but it could also mean the primary municipal service building &#8211; its where people go to interact and transact with their government.</p>
<p>How collaborative do these official facades look? Do they reach out and invite those with the desire to help to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/joiningforces/get-involved">get involved</a>? How hard do people have to look around for opportunities to apply their skills? If governments don&#8217;t ask, then they are missing a huge opportunity to not only engage more deeply with the people they serve but also to tap into <a href="https://medium.com/@bethnoveck/the-rise-of-the-citizen-expert-ffba66dea199#.m3uebcttn">expertise that is sitting dormant in their own communities</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4498" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2016/03/10/civic-onboarding/help-me-help-you/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/help-me-help-you.gif" data-orig-size="1087,625" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="help-me-help-you" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/help-me-help-you.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/help-me-help-you.gif?w=1000" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4498" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/help-me-help-you.gif?w=1000&#038;h=575" alt="help-me-help-you" width="1000" height="575" /></p>
<p>Good open source projects make it easy for new collaborators to join up and start contributing. Government should work like this too. Sadly, this is too infrequently the case.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s change that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Anonymous access to the data must be allowed for public data, including access through anonymous proxies. Data should not be hidden behind ‘walled gardens.’”<br />
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8211; <a href="http://opengovdata.org/">8 Principles of Open Government Data</a> </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the world of open data, there are few things that carry more weight than the original 8</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> principles</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> of open data.</span></p>
<p>Drafted by a group of influential leaders on open data that came together in Sebastopol, CA in 2007, this set of guidelines is the defacto standard for evaluating the quality of data released by governments, and is used by activists regularly to prod public organizations to become more open.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With this in mind, it was intriguing to hear a well known champion of open data at the Sunlight Foundation’s recent <a href="http://transparencycamp.org/">Transparency Camp</a> in Washington DC raise some interesting questions about one of these principles, typically considered sacrosanct in the open data community.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-3945"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;"><a href="https://twitter.com/technickle">Andrew Nicklin</a> (formerly at the helm of open data efforts for both the City and State of New York, and now Open Data Director for the <a href="http://centerforgov.org/">Center for Government Excellence</a> at Johns Hopkins University) asked Transparency Camp attendees to consider some of the implications of the 6th principle on open data &#8211; which calls for non-discriminatory access to data. This principle is generally taken to mean that users of open data should be able to access it anonymously and that governments should not require users to identify who they are or what they plan to do with the data as a condition of accessing it.</span></p>
<p>While there is obvious merit to this principle, Andrew observed that when governments know who is using their data and how they are using it, there are enormous opportunities to enhance the data and make it more useful for data consumers. If governments don’t understand what user&#8217;s want, providing useful data that can meet their needs is difficult &#8211; strictly enforcing anonymous access to data may end up being be an impediment to better understanding what data users actually need.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Without being directly critical of the principle or the original intentions behind it, Andrew made a thoughtful suggestion for open data advocates at Transparency Camp to consider. To me, these comments highlight an important issue facing the civic technology community and governments themselves &#8211; one that almost no one is talking about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When it comes to building the infrastructure of open data &#8211; putting in place the pieces of technology that users will leverage to find and use government open data &#8211; very little thought seems to be given to what users &#8211; data consumers &#8211; want or need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The idea of “build with, not for” has become a central tenant to how civic technology solutions are designed and implemented. Yet this idea seldom applies to the platforms that governments use to make open data available, which form the foundation of many civic technology solutions.</span></p>
<p><strong>Costs and Benefits</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Funding is the most cited barrier to implementing or expanding open data initiatives.”<br />
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8211; </span><a href="http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/CivicTechUSCOpenDataLACounty.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">Empowering the Public Through Open Data</span></a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A recent collaborative effort between the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership &amp; Policy and the USC Price School of Public Policy produced a </span><a href="http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/CivicTechUSCOpenDataLACounty.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">hugely valuable report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> on the current state of open data in the 88 incorporated cities comprising Los Angeles County.</span></p>
<p>Based on surveys and interviews with city officials on their open data efforts, this report provides unique insights into the ways that government leaders view open data. Among the findings &#8211; government officials surveyed for the report consider funding to be the most significant barrier to expanding work on open data. This isn’t a surprise, and this sentiment is likely not unique to the Los Angeles County area.</p>
<p>But when taken together with other findings, it can seem counterintuitive. Along with citing funding as a constraint, government officials expressed a preference for commercial open data catalogs over open source (or free) alternatives. These commercial solutions &#8211; some of which impose non-trivial costs on local governments &#8211; appear to meet a perceived need on the part of government officials in that they are viewed as making it “easier to publish [data] and put it in the hands of the citizens.”</p>
<p>Commercial software generally tends to fare better in the government procurement process than open source software, so this outcome isn’t all that shocking. But it’s worth noting this contradiction in the findings of the USC report between the cost constraints limiting more progress on open data and the reported preference for (sometimes pricy) commercial open data catalogs.</p>
<p>Cost aside, there are a few reasons why upfront investment in a commercial open data catalog may not be the best way to start a new open data effort.</p>
<p><strong>Architecting Participation </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The web &#8230; took the idea of participation to a new level, because it opened participation not just to software developers but to all users of the system.<br />
&#8211; Tim O&#8217;Reilly, <a href="http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/articles/architecture_of_participation.html">The Architecture of Participation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">First, and somewhat ironically, public information on the cost of commercial open data portals can be hard to come by. </span><a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/06/24/52343/how-much-do-open-data-portals-cost-so-cal-governme/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Another report on municipal open data efforts in southern California</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> found a wide disparity in what different governments &#8211; some just a few miles apart, and almost identical in population &#8211; pay for commercial open data catalogs. This can make it difficult for governments to know if they are getting good value for the price being paid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In addition, commercial open data catalogs often come with visualization, mapping and charting tools out of the box. This can make it easier for governments to augment open data offerings by showing what can be done with it. Though </span><a href="https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/204798848-Getting-Started-with-Data-Lens"><span style="font-weight:400;">these offerings</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> may come at an additional price, some may view them as a way to help advocate open data to internal skeptics &#8211; a picture (or a graph, or a chart) is worth a thousand words as the saying goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">From a user needs perspective, this approach feels very unidirectional &#8211; this is government telling the data community what it believes is important, not the other way around. There are a host of examples of sophisticated visualizations and applications </span><a href="http://www.citylab.com/crime/2013/02/5-ways-visualizing-crime-philadelphia/4641/"><span style="font-weight:400;">being built with government data by outside data users</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. And while this approach requires outreach and engagement, there is an ever increasing abundance of tools available for members of the data community to use to create <a href="http://academy.cartodb.com/">maps</a>, <a href="https://getconnect.io/">visualizations</a> and new applications.</span></p>
<p>These two approaches &#8211; out of the box vs. community built &#8211; are not mutually exclusive. We can see a number of examples of governments using commercial open data catalogs to engage with external data users that produce useful, valuable visualizations and apps &#8211; New York City, the City of Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco are all great examples of this dual approach.</p>
<p>However, open data efforts in all of those cities have benefited from robust technology and startup communities and often visionary leadership. Almost all of these cities have a long tradition of civic hacking. For cities that don&#8217;t have these assets (or have them in smaller quantities), outreach and engagement to nurture and build a data community will be a crucial factor in the long-term success of an open data program. These cities &#8211; many of them smaller and with more limited resources &#8211; may also feel the cost constraints of implementing an open data effort more acutely than larger cities.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that the next wave of cities that adopt open data programs may face a very different set of challenges than the cities that have come before them.</p>
<p><strong>Putting Users First</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The procurement model of government digital services generally leads to services that satisfy policy needs, not user needs.”<br />
<span style="font-weight:400;">&#8211; </span><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/playbooks/technology-procurement/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Government Technology Procurement Playbook</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, Code for America</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The time feels right to rethink how cities put in place the basic infrastructure of open data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At last year’s Code for America Summit, </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">I gave a talk on how open data was being adopted in small to midsized cities in the U.S</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. In researching my talk, I found that while larger cities have almost all implemented some form of open data program, less than 20% of the 256 incorporated places in this U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 have an open data program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Open data in this country is still &#8211; almost exclusively &#8211; a big city phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Efforts to address this imbalance are underway &#8211; the </span><a href="http://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative (of which the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins is a key part) is now working to bring open data and data-driven decision making to 100 mid sized cities. More and more small and mid sized cities are starting to look at open data as a key driver of government innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We are now at a juncture where we can not only help a new cohort of cities adopt open data, but to help ensure that these efforts embrace the principle of “build with, not for” from the ground up. If we’re going to be successful, it’s important that we question long-held beliefs &#8211; like the original 8 principles of open data &#8211; to ensure our efforts are most efficiently aligned with the outcomes we desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s worth considering whether commercial open data catalogs provide the best option for the next wave of cities that are embracing open data to succeed and build a healthy data culture, both inside and outside of government.</span></p>
<p>But whatever foundation we choose to lay for the next phase of open data, we&#8217;ll need to make sure we&#8217;re putting user&#8217;s needs first.</p>
<p>(Note &#8211; the term &#8220;cult of catalogs&#8221; is not my own. I first heard it used by <a href="https://twitter.com/pudo">Friedrich Lindenberg</a>, though others may have used it as well.)</p>

<p>In <a href="https://civic.io/2015/06/26/govtech-is-not-broken/">another recent post</a>, I talked about how public sector technology procurement was not well suited for the digital age.</p>
<p>But there are some efforts underway that seek to identify new methods of procuring technology solutions for government. As these ideas start to take hold, there is hope that those in the govtech community will create a set of strategies for more successfully implementing public sector technology solutions.</p>
<h4>Built to fail?</h4>
<p>The design of procurement policies that are used by our federal, state, and local governments are meant to encourage broad participation by requiring things like public announcements of solicitations, open vendor meetings, and fixed deadlines for submitting responses. The hope is to make the process as predictable and transparent as possible, and to level the playing field so that any qualified vendor can participate.</p>
<p>Procurement policies are also designed to mitigate risk and to ensure that selected vendors are competent and capable of undertaking the work required in government IT projects. It is important that these policies be consistent with the government’s duty to be responsible stewards of public resources.</p>
<p>In light of this, there is a great irony in the outcomes that these policies often seem to produce.</p>
<p><span id="more-4661"></span></p>
<p>Participation in government IT projects tends to be constrained to a subset of larger firms that regularly compete for contracts, while smaller, more nimble firms get squeezed out. In addition, the mechanisms meant to mitigate risk in government IT projects all too often seem to miss the mark in preventing technology projects from being delayed, <a class="external" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value" target="_blank">going over budget</a>, or failing altogether.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a need to redesign government IT procurement policies to more frequently produce the outcomes we desire.</p>
<p>In order to do this, government officials will be faced with some hard choices.</p>
<h4>Time is of the essence</h4>
<p>One of the most common complaints about the current technology procurement process is simply that it “takes too long.” Interestingly, you can hear this complaint from both government officials and vendors.</p>
<p>The length of time it takes for the procurement process to finish is a particularly acute one for technology projects. Smaller firms which may be proficient in the latest platforms and development methodologies can get squeezed out simply because they do not have the resources or the institutional endurance to go through the process.</p>
<p>In addition, the technology landscape can change quickly with new ways of building powerful solutions emerging every day. Governments are often saddled with obsolete technology and long procurement cycles can exacerbate this problem.</p>
<p>Why does the public procurement process seem to take so long?</p>
<p>If we look closely, we can see that the specific design elements that have been engineered into the technology procurement process to support the goals of transparency and risk mitigation are almost always time intensive.</p>
<p>An abbreviated solicitation may mean less time to get the word out to prospective bidders, or complaints that not everyone was aware of a specific procurement opportunity. Utilizing a fixed schedule for vendor meetings, responding to questions about a solicitation, reviewing bids, and announcing a selected firm can sometimes take months.</p>
<p>Even after an award has been made, the process can take several months before work actually begins. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia—where I once worked—for technology projects, the period between a contract award (when a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of a contract (the beginning of actual work on the project) takes an average of four months.</p>
<p>This period of time is often used to review terms and conditions, legal stipulations, critical milestones and other issues that will govern the project as work gets done—all of which are meant to insulate the government from unforeseen risk.</p>
<p>So if time is the essential ingredient used to ensure that the procurement process is open and transparent, and also the primary tool used to ensure risk mitigation for governments then procurement reformers have some tough decisions to make. Reformers—and government officials—must either be willing to accept less openness and transparency (or, at least, the perception of it) and more risk for governments to expedite procurement cycles.</p>
<p>These don’t seem like the kind of tradeoffs that will be palatable to policy makers. We need new techniques for promoting openness and diminishing risk in the technology procurement process.</p>
<h4>DESIGNING NEW STRATEGIES</h4>
<p>One of the entities developing new techniques for mitigating risk in the technology procurement process is<a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>.</p>
<p>18F is a <a class="external" href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/04/22/the-difference-between-18f-and-usds/" target="_blank">new group</a> formed in the wake of the Presidential Innovation Fellow program within the General Services Administration (GSA). The organization, which focuses on bringing 21st Century digital practices to the federal agencies, takes its name from the location of GSA’s offices in Washington D.C.,at the corner of 18th Street and F Street.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, 18F <a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/" target="_blank">began work on a new process</a> for agile technology services for federal agencies. Interestingly, in developing this new approach the group zeroed in on the time component of the procurement process and articulated how this can often be a detriment to efficient technology acquisitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reality is that business priorities, user needs, and technologies evolve and emerge on a continual basis. To keep pace, software acquisitions need to move at the speed of <b>agile </b>development cycles. Ideally, this means less than four weeks from solicitation to contract kickoff, and from there no more than three months to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP).</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the more interesting aspects of this new approach from 18F is that it employs a new technique to help mitigate risk. Participating vendors are <a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/15/agile-bpa-is-here/" target="_blank">required to show their work</a> in advance to demonstrate competency:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re requiring vendors to submit a working prototype based on a public dataset and show their work in a publicly available git repository. We’re also requiring ourselves to adopt a rigorous evaluation methodology to ensure that the vendors can meet our needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This approach is similar to one that was <a class="external" href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/" target="_blank">tested by the City of Philadelphia in 2013</a>, and it’s easy to see how it could be a much more effective way to mitigate risk in government technology projects. Requiring prospective vendors to submit an example of their work in a public git repository promotes transparency and provides and an advance view of the quality of their work. In addition, it can help ensure alignment with the agile principles that 18F is trying to implement.</p>
<p>Some have criticized this approach because—for now—it is only available to vendors that are already on the federal <a class="external" href="http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506" target="_blank">Schedule 70 for IT services</a>, and does not expand the universe of potential vendors to include firms that ordinarily might be shut out of the process. But I think this is exactly the kind of approach that is needed to redesign the way that governments procure technology services and solutions. The process of change has to begin somewhere, and as a first step 18F’s <a class="external" href="https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/assets/ADS_RFQ_Final.pdf" target="_blank">Agile Delivery BPA</a> is impressive.</p>
<p>Though a relatively new organization, it’s worth noting that some have been <a class="external" href="http://www.meritalk.com/blog.php?user=SteveOKeeffe&amp;blogentry_id=3971" target="_blank">more broadly critical of the efforts of 18F</a> and have questioned the organization’s potential for lasting impact. Most of this criticism tends to focus on a lack of tangible projects that the group—as yet—can point to as indicators of change to the way that federal agencies deploy technology solutions.</p>
<p>But as important as individual projects that can be listed in a press release are, it is equally important that this group—and <a class="external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service" target="_blank">others</a> working within the federal government—change the culture and processes that have for so long hindered the way that agencies use technology.</p>
<p>If the Agile Delivery BPA is any indication, 18F is an organization that will have a fundamental and long-term impact on how the federal government does business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about the challenges that face governments in acquiring and implementing new technology, the conversation eventually winds around to the procurement process.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when things usually get ugly. &#8220;It&#8217;s broken,&#8221; they say. &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>What most people who care about this issue fail to recognize, however, is that while the procurement process for technology may not work well for governments or prospective vendors (particularly smaller, younger companies), it is not broken. </p>
<p>It works exactly as it was designed to work.</p>
<p><span id="more-3861"></span></p>
<h4>Squeezing out the little guys</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a detailed account of what the government procurement process looks like from the perspective of a small startup, there is an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/18/why-govtech-is-broken/">interesting article in VentureBeat</a> that gives the account of <a href="http://tallyvoting.com/">TallyVoting</a> &#8211; a voting technology startup that is closing down after trying to penetrate the government market.</p>
<p>Here are some specific criticisms raised by the team behind TallyVoting.</p>
<p>The process moves too slowly&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
Governments move slowly compared to regular industry. Compared to the tech sector, government moves at a glacial pace. Selling stuff — not just technology — to government requires sourcing leads, submitting proposals and counter-proposals, securing external certification, periods for official and public comments, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The process is to costly and complex, particularly for smaller firms&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
That long sales cycle doesn’t give a small bootstrapped startup a chance to demonstrate the potential of its concept and technology. (Unsurprisingly, the already-giant vendors with a stronghold on the market are more than able to handle this long cycle. They’re also more interested in profits than improvements and innovation.) It also doesn’t give the little startups the opportunity to show traction and product-market fit.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These are fair criticisms, but we often make the mistake in discussing them of assuming that they are unintended problems that arise through some general disfunction of government. </p>
<p>These issues are not accidental, and it&#8217;s time we reframed the discussion around procurement reform accordingly.</p>
<h4>The procurement process is too costly and complex</h4>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that it&#8217;s current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualities &#8211; no one would argue that these requirements are adopted in the hopes of fostering positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants. </p>
<p>This is true, even if the positive outcomes are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for. Much like with our tax system, the added complexity borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion &#8211; in fact, much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms to build or acquire technology.</p>
<p>Requirements like <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Proposal+Bond">proposal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond">performance bonds</a>, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth) &#8211; to name just a few &#8211; are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they rely on a vendor. </p>
<p>In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources. However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesn&#8217;t seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of technology projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard representatives of smaller firms argue that the bond industry doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to underwrite technology projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result &#8211; many smaller firms that are well qualified to do the work may choose to simply walk away from the process. This is true even if these bond provisions don&#8217;t lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of larger technology projects.</p>
<p>Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants can not guarantee the intended results. </p>
<p>A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large project &#8211; particularly technology projects &#8211; is to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully. Fortunately, we are starting to see this happen at the federal level with the creation of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">USDS</a>.</p>
<h4>The procurement process moves too slowly</h4>
<p>While this seems particularly acute in the procurement process, this is also a fair criticism of government in general.</p>
<p>We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process &#8211; much of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._47">by design</a>. But long procurement and <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">budget cycles</a> can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that don&#8217;t provide a return for months on end.</p>
<p>There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and rules that ensure all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to actually begin work.</p>
<p>An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can take to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.</p>
<h4>Some things we can do to make procurement better</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, here are &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement</strong></p>
<p>Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP. In the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process. When I worked in Philly, we had some success in using these smaller projects to test <a href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/">new ideas and strategies</a> for partnering with small local vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.</p>
<p><strong>Identify clear standards for projects</strong></p>
<p>Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic technology and data standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:5px;">
<li>The various components that a system will use.</li>
<li>The environment in which it will be housed.</li>
<li>The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;can go a long way to reduce the risk an uncertainly inherent in technology projects. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of standards that are usually made part of any technology solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date &#8211; they must undergo constant review and refinement.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard. </p>
<p><strong>Require open source</strong></p>
<p>Requiring technology projects to be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that every vendor needs to open source their entire platform, but if governments are contracting with outside companies to build new, custom software solutions &#8211; and there are no security or other considerations that would make it impractical &#8211; then why not make them open source?</p>
<p>Government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source tools &#8211; leveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active community &#8211; to foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia">make the code behind their project open source</a>, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.</p>
<p><strong>Develop internal capacity for IT project management and implementation</strong></p>
<p>Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing and managing technology projects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government (particularly at the state and local level) with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.</p>
<p>Governments need to find ways to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities. </p>
<p><strong>Make contracting, lobbying and campaign contribution data public as open data</strong></p>
<p>One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the many postmortem reviews of the healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/">spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying</a>. It&#8217;s a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firms &#8211; who lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officials &#8211; to simply throw up their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and contributions to political campaigns is open.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possible &#8211; including small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices. </p>
<p>None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near term &#8211; these are items that I personally think are important and very achievable. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time for us to stop pretending that the problems with government technology procurement are an accident. </p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to fix things, we need to design a better system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an expanded version of a talk I gave last week at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67AXJ_Y1VEA&amp;list=PL65XgbSILalWFStqV0z0N9pvftstJ8AAh&amp;index=46">Code for America Summit</a>. </p>
<h4>An uneven future</h4>
<blockquote><p>
“The future is already here – it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed.”<br />
William Gibson. The Economist, December 4, 2003
</p></blockquote>
<p>The last time I herd Tim O&#8217;Reilly speak was at the <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/accela-engage-2014/event-summary-0aeb5c9d1b864806a08493267b8b185e.aspx">Accela Engage</a> conference in San Diego earlier this year. In his remarks, Tim used the above quote from William Gibson &#8211; it struck me as a pretty accurate way to describe the current state of open data in this country.</p>
<p>Open data is the future – of how we govern, of how public services are delivered, of how governments engage with those that they serve. And right now, it is unevenly distributed. I think there is a strong argument to be made that data standards can provide a number of benefits to small and mid-sized municipal governments and could provide a powerful incentive for these governments to adopt open data.</p>
<p>One way we can use standards to drive the adoption of open data is to partner with companies like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/healthscores">Yelp</a>, <a href="http://www.zillow.com/research/data/">Zillow</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference">Google</a> and others that can use open data to enhance their services. But how do we get companies with 10s and 100s of millions of users to take an interest in data from smaller municipal governments?</p>
<p>In a word &#8211; <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/data-formats/">standards</a>.</p>
<h4>Why do we care about cities?</h4>
<p>When we talk about open data, it’s important to keep in mind that there is <a href="https://www.data.gov/open-gov/">a lot of good work happening</a> at the federal, state and local levels all over the country. Plenty of states and even counties doing good things on the open data front, but for me it’s important to evaluate where we are on open data with respect to cities. </p>
<p>States typically occupy a different space in the service delivery ecosystem than cities, and the kinds of data that they typically make available can be vastly different from city data. State capitols are often far removed from our daily lives and we may hear about them only when a budget is adopted or when the state legislature <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/stories-wendy-davis-anti-abortion-bill-filibuster/story?id=19506336">takes up a controversial issue</a>. </p>
<p>In cities, the people that represent and serve us us can be our neighbors &#8211; the guy behind you at the car wash, or the woman who’s child is in you son’s preschool class. Cities matter.</p>
<p>As cities go, we need to consider carefully that importance of smaller cities &#8211; there are <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2012/PEPANNRSIP.US12A">a lot more of them</a> than large cities and a non-trivial number of people live in them.</p>
<p>If we think about small to mid-sized cities, these governments are central to providing a core set of services that we all rely on. They run police forces and fire services. They collect our garbage. They’re intimately involved in how our children are educated. Some of them operate transit systems and airports. Small cities matter too.</p>
<h4>Big cities vs. small cities on open data</h4>
<p>So if cities are important &#8211; big and small &#8211; how are they doing on open data? It turns out that big cities have adopted open data with much more regularity than smaller cities.</p>
<p>If we look at data from the Census Bureau on incorporated places in the U.S. and information <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNAXuadeXIxdG4xbnBTVnpVVkFQWUFBM1JGeEt4OEE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=2">from a variety of sources</a> on governments that have adopted open data policies and making open data available on a public website, we see the following:</p>
<p><strong>Big Cities:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:12px;">
<li>9 of the 10 largest US cities have adopted open data.</li>
<li>19 of the top 25 most populous cities have adopted open data.</li>
<li>Of cities with populations &gt; 500k, 71% have adopted open data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Small Cities:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:12px;">
<li>256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 500k – 100k.</li>
<li>Only 39 have open data policy or make open data available.</li>
<li>A mere 15% of smaller cities have adopted open data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data behind this analysis is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsNAXuadeXIxdG4xbnBTVnpVVkFQWUFBM1JGeEt4OEE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0">here</a>. As we can see, it shows a markedly different adoption rate for open data between large cities (those with populations of 500,000 or more) and smaller cities (those with populations between 100,000 and 500,000).</p>
<h4>Why is this important?</h4>
<p>We could chalk up this difference to the fact that big cities simply have more data. They may have more people asking for information, which can drive the release of open data. They have larger pools of technologists, startups and civic hackers to use the data. They may have more resources to publish open data, and to manage communities of users around that data.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that there is one definitive answer here &#8211; there&#8217;s ample room for discussion on this point.</p>
<p>We should care about this because &#8211; quite simply &#8211; a lot of people call smaller cities home. If we add up the populations of the 256 places noted above with populations between 100,000 and 500,000, it actually exceeds the combined population of the 34 largest cities (with populations of 500,000 or more) &#8211; 46,640,592 and 41,155,553 respectively. Right now these people are potentially missing out on the many <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/why-open-data/">benefits of open data</a>.</p>
<p>But more than simple math, if one of the virtues of our approach to democracy in this country is that we have lots of governments below the federal level to act as “laboratories of democracy” then we’re missing an opportunity here. If we can get more small cities to embrace open data, we can encourage more experimentation, we can evaluate the kinds of data that these cities release and what people do with it. We can learn more about what works &#8211; and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>In addition, we now know that open data is one tool that can be used to <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/14-034_3dcc83ea-aa8d-463d-bd66-d0ff8c267506.pdf">help address historically low trust in government institutions</a>. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-shooting-20140928-story.html">not hard to find</a> smaller governments in this country that could use all the help they can get in repairing relations with those they serve.</p>
<h4>How do we fix this?</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s at least a few things we can do to address this problem.</p>
<p>First, we need more  options for smaller governments to release open data. We&#8217;re not going make progress in getting smaller governments to adopt open data if the cost of standing up a data portal has the same budget impact as the salary for a teacher, or a cop, or a firefighter, or a building inspector &#8211; I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s sustainable.</p>
<p>Equally important, we need to work on developing useful new <a href="https://civic.io/2013/02/26/on-data-standards-for-cities/">data standards</a>. This won&#8217;t always be easy, but it&#8217;s important work and we need to do it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/515255103909949440"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tweet-open-data.png?w=500&#038;h=288" alt="open data standards tweet" width="500" height="288" class="aligncenter" /></a></p>
<p>For smaller cities without the deep technology, journalism and research communities that can help drive open data adoption, data standards are a way to export civic technology needs to larger cities. I believe they are critical to driving adoption of open data in the many small and midsized cities in this country.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen what open data looks like in big cities, and they are already moving to take <a href="http://plenar.io/">the next steps</a> in the evolution of their open data programs &#8211; but smaller cities risk getting left behind.</p>
<p>They next frontier in open data is in small and mid-sized cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago next month, the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s open data portal was <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/04/25/data-crunched-all-that%E2%80%99s-needed-to-jump-start-an-open-data-movement-is-a-city-government-that-doesn%E2%80%99t-stand-in-the-way/">launched by local technology firm Azavea</a> as part of the inaugural Philly Tech Week. Two years ago next month, Philadelphia joined the small (but growing) fraternity of cities to adopt a formal open data policy &#8211; a milestone that stands as one of the first in something I think of as an &#8220;experiment&#8221; in municipal transparency. </p>
<p>Since this experiment first began, our open data efforts have come a very long way, and Philadelphia is now looked at as a national leader on open data and civic technology. In many ways it is now time for a new chapter in the Philadelphia experiment &#8211; our city is ready to take open data to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, though, it is time to step back and take a different role in the Philadelphia technology community and the broader open data effort &#8211; both here and in other places.</p>
<p><strong>How Far We&#8217;ve Come</strong></p>
<p>In the last several years, Philadelphia has grown into a national leader on open data and civic technology. We enthusiastically <a href="http://ph.ly/OpenDataGuide">share our experience and our ideas</a> with other municipalities that want to kick off their own open data experiment.</p>
<p>Our open data portal contains <a href="https://trello.com/b/iUUy84lK/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline">dozens of new data sets</a> added since the adoption of our open data policy, some released for the very first time by city government. The <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">OpenDataPhilly</a> platform has inspired <a href="http://www.opendatacincy.org/">efforts in other cities</a> that look to us as a model for how to implement their open data efforts.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObrlsMA7c3M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>We have embraced not only open data, but also open source software and we are actively <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia">sharing both our code and our data on platforms like GitHub</a> as a way to engage with the broader data community and tap into communities of innovators. The City of Philadelphia now has <a href="http://government.github.com/stories/philadelphia-gets-going-and-gets-open/">more public GitHub repos</a> than any other city in the country, and more are on the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re leading the discussion on the development of new <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-headd/how-technology-can-fight-the-flu_b_4495730.html">municipal data standards</a> that will help speed the adoption of other open data releases, and enhance the value of civic technology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re finding innovative new ways to engage with local technology vendors by making <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/">opportunities for smaller technology projects more visible</a>. We&#8217;re <a href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/">using GitHub</a> and other platforms to make responding to technology procurement opportunities easier, more engaging and more valuable.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="http://phlapi.com/">growing suite of developer-ready APIs</a> that can be used to quickly and easily create powerful new civic apps. And, most importantly, we&#8217;re collaborating with <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">one of the most active civic hacking communities in the country</a> and helping to enable the building of all sorts of <a href="http://www.phlcrimemapper.com/">new</a> <a href="http://lti.planphilly.com/">awesome</a> <a href="http://groundedinphilly.org/">apps</a>. </p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia is ready for the next chapter in its open data experiment. </p>
<p>The milestones that lay ahead will see the release of important new data sets that will enable more meaningful and more sustainable <a href="http://ph.ly/DiscussPhillyData">civic engagement in our city</a>. These new data releases and APIs will also help create the foundation for unprecedented collaboration between city departments and other governments. No force has more potential to enable <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/">significant improvements in government efficiency and operations</a> than open data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be watching all of this unfold from a new vantage point &#8211; as a member (once again) of the Philly technology and civic hacking communities. In early April, I&#8217;ll step down from my post as Chief Data Officer and return to being a professional technologist. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking more in the weeks ahead about exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing, but I&#8217;ll still be working with governments and open data. I&#8217;ll also still be in Philly &#8211; my wife and I will continue to live and work here, and our kids will still go to school here.</p>
<p>It has truly been an honor and a privilege to serve this great city, and I owe a debt of gratitude to Managing Director Rich Negrin and CIO Adel Abeid for the opportunity. I look forward to continuing to do so going forward, but from outside city government.</p>
<p>Philly&#8217;s open data effort has always been bigger than any one person &#8211; it&#8217;s always been about the community. It&#8217;s now time for me to rejoin that community.</p>
<p>See you at the next <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/events/hackathons/">hackathon</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sustaining civic technology will mean that both government&#8217;s IT infrastructure and the civic technology sector that builds on it will need to change.</p>
<p>A pair of recent blog posts caught my eye and highlighted this theme in my head, and motivated me to capture a few thoughts on this topic.</p>
<p>The first post was by Dan O&#8217;Neil, Executive Director of the Smart Chicago Collaborative. <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2014/02/some-thoughts-toward-the-maturation-of-the-civic-innovation-sector-of-the-technology-industry.html">Dan&#8217;s post</a> on the the things that need to happen to drive the &#8220;&#8230;maturation of the civic innovation sector of the technology industry&#8221; are worth the read. It&#8217;s a great post that helps highlight the connection between legacy IT system in government and open data, which is used to build civic technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;[without] existing legacy gov IT systems, there would be no civic tech. The data we use for our civic tech projects doesn’t get collected, managed, and exported by itself.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The second post is from the Bay Area design firm Stamen, and highlights the need for data visualizations (and other bits of civic technology that rely on open data) to be maintained over time. The post <a href="http://content.stamen.com/a_tale_of_two_cities_maps">uses the analogy of gardening</a> to underscore the need to constantly update and maintain the things we build with data.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If you plant a flower in a garden and then never give it water or light, it will in fact die. Unless, of course, it happens to placed in just the perfect spot, in which case it will need to be pruned. Either way, some kind of tending is always required.</p>
<p>We don’t always think of digital works in the same way, perhaps because their metaphor of creation more closely resembles that of a built object, like a bookcase or building. But even buildings need maintenance, and after so many years, the shelves on the bookcase may falter and need new ones. We need to be more conscious about this aspect of dynamic data visualization, at the outset.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>These two posts call out the need for both the government technology systems that lie at the foundation of open data, and the civic technology that uses this data to get better. To mature. To advance to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, the takeaways from these two posts are pretty clear.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and civic apps are like gardening &#8211; except when they&#8217;re not.</strong></p>
<p>I like the analogy of gardening applied to investment in technology solutions. It underscores the need to continually invest in the maintenance and upkeep of the solutions that are used to consume government data. However, I think there is some danger in using this analogy in that it obscures the the fundamental nature of change in the technology world. </p>
<p>I can tend my garden today in pretty much the same way as someone did 100 years ago &#8211; soil, water and sunshine. Boom. However, when building a technology solution (particularly web-based solutions) its not feasible to use the same approach or components that might have been acceptable as recently as 10 years ago. Budgeting for maintenance and enhancements for technology projects isn&#8217;t a nice to have &#8211; its absolutely essential to their success. The pace of change in the world of technology is just too fast for anything less.</p>
<p><strong>We have to fix the budget process as it relates to investment in technology.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">harped on this before</a>, but we most definitely need to get better at helping non-technology people in government (particularly budget officials) understand the need for continuous support and maintenance of IT projects. Correction &#8211; we need to help them understand technology better in general. Not since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(U.S._TV_series)#Seasons">first season of The Bachelor</a> has there been a worse match than the current public budgeting process and the pace of change in the world of technology.</p>
<p>To understand how acute this problem is, ask some you know that works in state or local government if they (or someone they work with) interacts as part of their job with a technology system that is 10 years old or older. I think the responses would be surprising to many people, and rather alarming to most professional technologists.</p>
<p><strong>Government needs to embrace its role as a data steward</strong></p>
<p>Governments need to understand their role in the civic technology production chain. The current public budgeting and procurement processes make us lousy at investing in the kinds of technology that chance rapidly &#8211; like those that power web-based solutions. </p>
<p>When I read the post by Stamen about their Crimespotting project with the City of Oakland, I see a city that hasn&#8217;t accepted its role as a mature data steward:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;over the years, the project started wavering. Oakland’s API has sputtered to the point of being nonfunctional, rendering Oakland Crimespotting totally spotless.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If governments are serious about open data, they need to invest in systems that will make their data easy to consume and readily available &#8211; without this, the civic technology sector won&#8217;t go far. </p>
<p>I think part of this is <a href="https://civic.io/2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/">accepting the role of data steward</a>, and engineering our IT infrastructure accordingly. I don&#8217;t know if Stamen&#8217;s was the only project consuming the Oakland crime data API, but building a robust community of users around open data can help public officials see the importance of investing to keep these systems stable and available.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t underestimate the  power of open source</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to helping ensure that civic technology solutions continue to thrive after launch, there is almost nothing better than leveraging the power of open source. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with closed source solutions built on top of open data, but if governments are paying for custom solutions from vendors to display open data we should <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia/myPhillyRising">insist that the underlying code be open sourced</a>. This can go a long way toward helping ensure that it continues to evolve over time, as civic technologists contribute fixes and enhances and (potentially) as other governments fork these solutions for their own use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see the conversation around civic technology and open data focused on how we can take the great work that has been done to the next level. I think it means we&#8217;re ready for the next steps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of attending a civic hacking event jointly organized by <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">Code for Philly</a> and <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia">Girl Develop It Philly</a>. The event had a tremendously good turnout &#8211; over 50 people by my count &#8211; making it one of the larger events Code for Philly has organized in recent months.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cfa_gdi.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="cfa_gdi" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>The mission of Girl Develop It is to empower women to learn software development, and as a result there were a good number of people at the event being introduced to civic hacking for the first time. This got me thinking about ways to onboard people new to civic hacking (and people new to coding) into civic technology projects.</p>
<p>None of these is new, but here are five ideas I came up with after the event:</p>
<p><strong>Data Liberation</strong> &#8211; the foundation of civic hacking project is open data, and far too much of the data civic hackers need is locked up in broken websites and unusable formats. Helping to <a href="http://pdfliberation.wordpress.com/">break some of this data free</a> can be a tremendous benefit to open data users and civic hacking projects.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong> &#8211; far too many open source and civic hacking projects go without proper documentation to help other developers contribute and to support end users. Helping to create or expand documentation for a project can be critical to helping it succeed.</p>
<p><strong>User Testing</strong> &#8211; Organizing and conducting end user testing for civic technology projects is sadly rare. There are some <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/introducing-the-cut-group-get-paid-to-test-civic-apps/">efforts underway to change this</a> but in order for civic hacking projects to improve and succeed we need real feedback from mainstream users.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach</strong> &#8211; One legitimate criticism of civic apps is that too few people know they exist. There are efforts working to change this, like <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/">Apps for Philly</a> (still in its infancy) &#8211; a site that lists a host of different civic technology apps that are available for users. Adding new projects to this listing (and others like it) will both help these projects succeed and give the person doing it a much clearer sense of the civic technology landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Helper Libraries</strong> &#8211; a great way to get comfortable writing code and to help out a civic technology project is to write <a href="http://phlapi.com/libraries.html">helper libraries</a> for projects with APIs. At the Apps for Philly <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/events/transit-2013">Transit Hackathon</a>, one project utilized recently released data from the City of Philadelphia on bicycle thefts. The lead developer created a <a href="http://bikethefts.jeffsbox.net/">new API for this data</a> to enable other projects to use it. Building new client libraries in a range of different languages would be a great way to support other developers that want to incorporate bike theft data into their projects, and to get some hands on experience writing code.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to contribute to open source projects and to help support civic hacking efforts &#8211; these are just a few.</p>
<p>We need more great events like the one organized by Code for Philly and Girl Develop it Philly to bring together all of the talented people we have in our city to work on these important projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing in recent memory has focused attention on the need for wholesale reform of the government IT procurement system more than the troubled launch of <a href="http://healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/broken-car.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="broken-car" width="300" height="199" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;"></p>
<p>There has been a myriad of <a href="http://blog.dobt.co/post/63381111778/the-healthcare-gov-fiasco">blog posts</a>, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexhoward/how-the-first-internet-president-produced-american-governmen">stories</a> and <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/us/politics/from-the-start-signs-of-trouble-at-health-portal.html">articles</a> written in the last few weeks detailing all of the problems that led to the ignominious launch of the website meant to allow people to sign up for health care coverage.</p>
<p>Though the details of this high profile flop are in the latest headlines, the <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/23/will-lack-of-procurement-reform-smother-civic-startups/">underlying cause has been talked about many times before</a> &#8211; the process by which governments contract with outside parties to obtain IT services is broken.</p>
<p>The process clearly does not work well for governments &#8211; and many would argue that it does not work well for vendors either. Typical government procurement rules shut out many small firms that may be well positioned to execute on a government IT project but lack the organizational endurance to make it through the selection process.</p>
<p>What are the problems with the government procurement process and how can we fix them? How can we foster more participation in the procurement process by more firms that are qualified to do work? How can we lower the prices that governments pay for IT products and services and help ensure better quality? </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take on the major problems with the current system, and five recommendations for how we can start to fix them.</p>
<h4>The procurement process is too costly and complex</h4>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that it&#8217;s current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualities &#8211; no one would argue that these requirements are aimed at producing positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants. This is true, even if the positive outcomes desired are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for.</p>
<p>The added complexity borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion &#8211; in fact, much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms.</p>
<p>Requirements like <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Proposal+Bond">proposal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond">performance bonds</a>, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth) &#8211; to name just a few &#8211; are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they outsource work to a vendor. In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources.</p>
<p>However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesn&#8217;t seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of IT projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process. For example, many small firms argue that the bond industry doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to underwrite IT projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result &#8211; many smaller firms that may be well qualified to do work simply walk away from the process. This is true even of these provisions don&#8217;t lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of large IT projects.</p>
<p>Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>The use of these risk mitigation provisions at all levels of government helps highlight a more fundamental problem that is at the heart of the broken procurement process in government &#8211; a shocking <a href="https://civic.io/2013/06/06/the-case-for-making-procurement-harder/">lack of IT knowledge within government</a>. </p>
<p>A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large project &#8211; particularly IT projects &#8211; is to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully.</p>
<h4>The procurement process moves too slowly</h4>
<p>This is actually a fair criticism of government in general, but it is a particularly acute during the procurement process. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia the period between a contract award (a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of that contract (the beginning of actual work) can take an average of four months for some projects.</p>
<p>We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process &#8211; much of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._47">by design</a>. But long procurement and <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">budget cycles</a> can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that don&#8217;t provide a return for months on end.</p>
<p>There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and that all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to begin work.</p>
<p>An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can might to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.</p>
<h4>Some things we can do to make procurement better</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, here are &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement</strong></p>
<p>Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP (in the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process). In Philadelphia, we&#8217;ve had great success in using these smaller projects to test <a href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/">new ideas and strategies</a> for partnering with IT vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.</p>
<p>Narrowing the focus of any enhanced thresholds for streamlined budding to web-based projects would help mitigate risk and foster a quicker process for testing new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Identify clear standards for projects</strong></p>
<p>Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic IT standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:5px;">
<li>The various components that a system will use.</li>
<li>The environment in which it will be housed.</li>
<li>The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;can go a long way to reduce the risk an uncertainly inherent in IT projects. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of IT standards that are usually made part of any IT solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date &#8211; they must undergo constant review and refinement. In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard. </p>
<p><strong>Require open source</strong></p>
<p>Requiring that IT projects be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.</p>
<p>In addition, government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source tools &#8211; leveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active community &#8211; to foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia">make the code behind their project open source</a>, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.</p>
<p><strong>Develop a more robust internal capacity for IT project management and implementation</strong></p>
<p>Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing and managing technology projects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.</p>
<p>Governments need to find ways to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities. </p>
<p><strong>Make contracting, lobbying and campaign contribution data public as open data</strong></p>
<p>One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the analysis of healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/">spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying</a>. It&#8217;s a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firms &#8211; who lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officials &#8211; to simply throw up their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-campaign-finance-data">contributions to political campaigns</a> is open.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all prospective participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possible &#8211; including small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices. </p>
<p>None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near term &#8211; these are items that I personally think are important and very achievable. </p>
<p>One thing that could help speed the adoption of these and other changes is the development of robust communication framework between government contracting and IT professionals in different cities and different states. I think a &#8220;Municipal Procurement Academy&#8221; could go a long way toward achieving this.</p>
<p>Look for more details on a Municipal Procurement Academy &#8211; to train state and local officials on best practices for IT procurement &#8211; in a future post.</p>
