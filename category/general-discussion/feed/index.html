<p>It’s sort of a cliche to say it these days, but digital transformation in government is <a href="https://medium.com/@mheadd/process-eats-culture-for-breakfast-e5da02b2128e">largely not about technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems like this is an idea that has broad consensus, but much of the work that gets done in and around government technology modernization still views problems solely through the lens of technology. What if we approached this work differently? What if we viewed the problems of government technology through the lens of other disciplines?&nbsp;</p>



<span id="more-4798"></span>



<p>We don’t need to pretend we’re always experts in these other disciplines &#8211; we’re not going to convince our partners that we’re doctors or economists, because we are not. But it is often useful to look at the problems facing governments in implementing and managing digital solutions using the analytic tools and frameworks of non-technology disciplines.</p>



<p>The following is not an exhaustive list of ideas for doing this, and I may not be saying anything all that revolutionary here. But this is a summary of a few of the ideas for doing this I’ve been thinking about a lot lately.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Symptoms vs. cause</strong></p>



<p>It’s easy to spot bad technology &#8211; we often just point our browsers at a government website and our minds immediately begin to coalesce around solutions. We think we understand the problems and we move quickly &#8211; often too quickly &#8211; to find the answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s helpful sometimes to think of a government technology problem as a sick patient &#8211; one we must diagnose in order to prescribe a cure. The analytic frameworks of medicine accommodate the idea that what we see with our eyes or touch with our hands may not actually be the problem. Physicians work to identify the underlying cause of a malady and treat it, rather than simply addressing the symptoms that manifest for our eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so it is with government technology problems. Distinguishing between the symptoms and the cause is important. A broken website or failed system implementation are often the symptoms of larger, more fundamental problems. They are the symptoms, and if we simply treat them, the underlying malady will linger. And while there are plenty of other approaches in IT consulting that can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">help with root cause analysis</a>, I find it really helpful to think about the approach of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis#Differential_diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a>.</p>



<p>What are all of the possible things that could be causing the symptoms that we are seeing with our eyes? Which one of them (or which combination) makes the most sense in explaining what we are seeing, and which do not? This approach not only focuses on underlying causes, it inherently implies that there may be more than one cause for a problem &#8211; something that is often true when we work on government technology projects that have run into problems.</p>



<p><strong>Assuming rationality</strong></p>



<p>So much of the work we do in government technology modernization involves developing advice &#8211; lists of best practices, and guides to help agencies adopt technology more successfully. “Here is how agile works, here is why DevSecOps is so important, talk to users, scope projects smaller &#8211; now go do these things.” *</p>



<p>And while all of this guidance and content is valuable, this approach assumes that the sole problem facing development and service delivery teams is a lack of information. But what if we proceeded from the assumption that an information deficit was not the primary cause of technology dysfunction in a government agency, that delivery teams had access to information on how to properly run their projects but chose not to anyway? What would explain these decisions if lack of access to information on how to do it properly was not the issue?</p>



<p>It’s useful in these cases, I think, to look at an idea from the world of economics &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">rational choice theory</a>. This theory holds that individual actors in a market will act rationally and in their own self interest based on available information. I’m not suggesting that this theory explains everything about how markets work (it doesn’t), but it is a useful construct in helping us understand why service delivery teams &#8211; and government agencies more broadly &#8211; make the choices that they make. If we approach a technology problem using the assumption that the individuals making decisions will act rationally, then it helps us to focus on the reasons these choices get made.</p>



<p>Consider the directive to scope technology projects more modestly, and to iterate frequently. There is plenty of information and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_failed_and_overbudget_custom_software_projects">accumulated experience</a> to suggest that larger technology projects fail at a higher rate than smaller ones. If we assume that information deficit is not the root cause of decisions to scope projects bigger &#8211; i.e., project teams know that larger projects have increased risk of failure &#8211; then what explains the reasons that projects become large?</p>



<p>If we assume rationality, we might better understand the reasons why a service delivery team might choose a larger project over a smaller one. Consider the process to <a href="https://atos.open-control.org/steps/">accredit technology systems for production deployment</a> &#8211; this process usually involves a significant amount of paperwork and documentation on a litany of different security controls. It can sometimes cost a team more in terms of time and effort than the work to actually build a solution in the first place. Given the overhead involved in a process like this, it might make sense from a project team perspective to limit the need to run this gauntlet to as few times as possible &#8211; or even only once if that can be achieved. This might drive a team to enlarge a project scope, to reduce the number of iterations, and jam as much work into a release as possible so as to only pay the overhead of the accreditation process once.</p>



<p>Viewed in this way, we can see that the decision to scope a project more broadly is rational (from the perspective of the project team). It makes sense given the weight of the process that may be needed to get successive iterations of a solution released. It’s not that a project team isn’t aware of the risks of larger projects with fewer iterations, it’s that the environment in which they are building the solution favors larger projects. It “rewards” them with fewer trips through the accreditation labyrinth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a bit of a contrived example, but it’s not a stretch to apply this same line of reasoning to things like the procurement process (which can also be lengthy and costly) or other processes that have phase-gates with large documentation requirements at each step. Faced with the overhead of complying with these processes, it is rational to enlarge projects so as to pay this cost as few times as possible.<br></p>



<p>Understanding why delivery teams would make these decisions is key to understanding the root cause of technology dysfunction. The answer is often more expansive than just the technology being used.</p>



<p>We need to free our minds, to open up opportunities for thinking about problems differently. For this to work, we need to look at how other disciplines analyze problems and understand their causes. There’s so much room here to add to our standard tool kit for fixing government technology issues. As civic technologists, it’s up to us to find them and start using them.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Let’s fill up our tool box.</p>



<p>* &nbsp;<em>Oversimplified to make a point, but you get my drift.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why is it so hard for governments to adopt innovative new technologies?</p>
<p>Why does the public sector lag so far behind the private sector in leveraging new technology to create efficiencies?</p>
<p><img style="float:right;padding:5px;" title="Bizzaro" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/bizzaro.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="183" /></p>
<p>As an organization that works at the intersection of government and technology, these are questions we hear a lot at Code for America. Through our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/about/">various program offerings</a>, we are working to address the popular sentiments &#8211; and the underlying issues &#8211; that cause these questions to be asked so frequently.</p>
<p>Many observers point to the government procurement process as the chief impediment to adopting new technologies in government. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/23/will-lack-of-procurement-reform-smother-civic-startups/">made this same observation myself</a>, and public sector procurement is an area ripe for reform and new thinking.</p>
<p>But looking more globally at the incentives that drive how governments apply resources to acquire technology we can see another area where reform is badly needed to encourage innovation &#8211; the public budgeting process.</p>
<p><span id="more-2558"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in two different state governments, in both the legislative and executive branches, and I&#8217;ve seen the public budgeting process from a number of different perspectives. In every instance that I have seen it, there is not only a lack of incentives for government agencies to create efficiencies through the use of new technology, there are some rather strong disincentives for doing this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Government reform is qualitatively different from restructuring in firms and industries. Ironically, the substantial efficiency gains driving the development of e-commerce and industry change are disincentives for bureaucrats to use the Internet in government. Whereas dramatic efficiency gains and cost savings in the economy are rewarded through profits, promotions, stock price increases and market share, similar gains in government are rewarded with budget cuts, staff reductions, loss of resources and consolidation of programs. In this instance, incentives and rewards in the institution of government are the obverse of those in the market.</p>
<p>&#8212; Jane E. Fountain, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2001/virtual-state">Building the Virtual State</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Th typical public budget process begins with agencies submitting requests for funding to support their operations in the next fiscal year. Most commonly, agencies begin these discussions &#8211; first with executive branch budget officials, then later on with their legislative counterparts &#8211; from the basis of their current level of funding.</p>
<p>This &#8220;incrementalist&#8221; approach to public budgeting is common &#8211; the next year&#8217;s budget request is built on the allocation to that agency for the current year, with requests for new funding added on to the existing base.</p>
<p>In my experience working in government, I have found the personnel working at the operating agencies and departments to be passionate, deeply committed advocates for their agency&#8217;s clientele. These individuals are understandably more interested in the people their agency serves, and understandably less interested in the relative priority of spending items between different agencies and departments.</p>
<p>Mayors, governors, and legislators are, however, very interested in the aggregate level of spending and must balance competing priorities between agencies to ensure a balanced budget. In theory this means that resources may be redirected from one agency to another as competing interests get resolved within the framework of the overall budget.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that agencies that have unused allocations at the end of a fiscal year &#8211; money that is appropriated but not spent &#8211; will see those dollars redirected to another agency or policy priority (e.g., tax reduction, paying down debt) in the next budget cycle.</p>
<p>Mayors, governors, and legislators see this as an effective way to allocate finite resources between competing interests. If an agency doesn&#8217;t spend down their entire budget allocation, they must not need it and a reduction is justified.</p>
<p>Agencies see this as a diminution of their mission and a loss for the clientele that they serve and are advocates for. It is also a powerful disincentive for agencies to use new technologies to create efficiencies and cost savings.</p>
<p>Think of the incentives the budget process described here provides for agencies to try new things, to go before executive branch personnel or legislators and trumpet a success in implementing a new technology. Agencies that demonstrate a cost savings are not rewarded, they are &#8220;punished&#8221; with a reduction to their funding allocation for the next year.</p>
<p>In the bizzaro world that is public budgeting, it is the agencies that are relatively less efficient that get &#8220;rewarded&#8221; with increased budget allocations year over year.</p>
<p>Whether or not we agree with the incrementalist approach to public budgeting, or the portrayal of the self interested agency official being punished for efficiency, it seems clear that the process by which governments allocate resources for technology does not encourage innovation.</p>
<p>While a wholesale overhaul of the budgeting process seems impractical and difficult, there are some things governments can try to create new incentives for innovation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see a pilot project or program that rewards agencies that save money through the use of new technologies. If agencies can demonstrate a cost savings through the use of new technology, or by partnering with other agencies on a common technology need, they should be allowed to keep some (or all) of that savings to better serve their clientele.</p>
<p>In addition, if we can create new incentives within the public budgeting process to reward innovation, we will build pressure to reform other government processes that stifle innovation &#8211; like the procurement process.</p>
<p>Are there programs like this being tried in city or state governments somewhere? I&#8217;d love to hear about them if there are.</p>

There is also a <a href="http://www.govloop.com/profiles/blogs/gov-20-glitz-and-gabright" target="_blank">thoughtful piece on GovLoop</a> examining which aspects of Gov 2.0 are on the right track and the wrong track.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve raised <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1027">similar questions about Gov 2.0 efforts in the past</a>, and the need to tie them to quantifiable performance measures.</p>
<p>With all of the excitement around the country and around the world focused on opening public data and Gov 2.0, proponents need to take steps to tie these efforts back to the core mission of the governments and agencies that they serve.  If open data and Gov 2.0 are a fad, then their 15 minutes are probably almost up &#8212; the longevity of these efforts and initiatives will be a function solely of their ability to enhance the performance of governments.</p>
<p>Efforts that support open government data and greater use of alternative communication channels (like social media) for communicating with constituents are fast approaching an important tipping point.  The initial attraction of these efforts is that they are seen as forward thinking and cutting edge &#8212; they are inherently attractive because of their &#8220;newness.&#8221;  But when social media penetration has reached the point that even the local dogcatcher is on Twitter, its natural for people in government (particularly those that don&#8217;t live and breath this stuff) to start asking: &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?&#8221;</p>
<p>Skepticism is probably most imminent for open government data projects because they typically require some investment of staff time and other resources.  These efforts need to be carefully crafted to ensure a tangible relationship to the underlying mission of the governments or agencies undertaking them.  How does opening government data help realize the goals of an agency?  How does opening government data make the job of government cheaper or more effective?</p>
<p>These kinds of questions can be difficult (even offensive) to address when there is a strong belief in open government data as a principle. Nevertheless, if open government data projects and Gov 2.0 are to be around longer than 15 minutes, these are the types of questions that need to be answered.</p>
