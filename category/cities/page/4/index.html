		<p>Interesting things are happening at Philly Hackathons.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/its-alive.jpg?w=300&#038;h=204" alt="its-alive" width="300" height="204" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Increasingly, participants at local events are opting to work on what would best be described as &#8220;citizen science&#8221; projects &#8211; projects not focused on the development of an app as a final product, but where an app or device constructed at the event is the means to a loftier end. </p>
<p>The goal of these projects &#8211; a better understanding of how our city works and ways that we can improve it. Some great examples of these citizen science projects being worked on by Philly hackers are:</p>
<p><a href="http://greenstemnetwork.org/">Project GreenSTEM</a> &#8211; Originally developed as part of last year&#8217;s AT&amp;T EduTech Hackathon, this project is focused on the development of an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>-powered urban sensor network. It&#8217;s currently being <a href="http://citypaper.net/article.php?How-the-Water-Dept.-and-civic-hackers-are-helping-student-gardens-go-high-tech-20130">integrated into the curriculum</a> at four of Philadelphia&#8217;s public schools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyclephilly.org/">CyclePhilly</a> &#8211; Though this project is centered on an app, the ambitions of its sponsors are as big as the Delaware Valley. The goal of the project is to get as many bikers as possible to use the app to generate data on how they travel, which will inform planning decisions made by the City of Philadelphia and the <a href="http://www.dvrpc.org/">Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://climatetracker.wordpress.com/">Climate Tracker</a> &#8211; Another mobile sensor network project, this one is focused on bus-mounted devices that will collect climate and air quality information from around Philadelphia. The data generated will be used <a href="http://www.phillytreemap.org/">in conjunction with other data sets</a> to inform both citizens and researchers.</p>
<p>These citizen science projects still make up a minority of the things worked on at hackathons and <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">local hack nights</a>, but understanding why participants are opting to work on them can give us insights into how we might alter the structure of hackathons &#8211; to make them more effective and to help ensure the work being done at these events is sustained over the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>Opting for Science</strong></p>
<p>One of the unifying characteristics of the project listed above is that each is focused on the generation of data &#8211; data that can be used by others to make better decisions. The apps and sensors developed as part of these projects are incidental to a larger, more important goal. Generating data that can be used as part of scientific or administrative processes.</p>
<p>This is a fairly dramatic departure from the usual app-centric focus of hackathons.</p>
<p>The reasons that we are seeing more citizen science projects turn up at hackathons is the result of a couple of different factors. First, the availability of cheap, powerful microcomputers and sensors technology. Products like <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/bone">BeagleBone</a>, <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/collections/ninja-blocks">Ninja Blocks</a> others are making it incredibly cheap to obtain, work with and create powerful new devices.</p>
<p>It&#8217; also <a href="http://cylonjs.com/">becoming easier</a> for <a href="http://rad.rubyforge.org/">mainstream programmers</a> to start to work with hardware, robotics and other kinds of physical device technologies. These developments are putting pressure on the traditional structure of hackathons, which are set up to produce apps. </p>
<p>Most hackathons are set up to run over a specific period of time &#8211; much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)">a sprint</a> in agile software development. And many of the conventions used in hackathons (like demoing a workable prototype at the end) conform to the practices of software development methodologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#End_meetings">Scrum</a>. (This isn&#8217;t surprising since hackathons originally came out of the world of software development.)</p>
<p>In short, hackathons are almost always structured in a traditional way &#8211; one designed to deliver apps, not citizen science projects. So the fact that we are starting to see these projects developed at hackathons despite the structural bias toward apps is noteworthy. </p>
<p><strong>Making Hackathons Better</strong></p>
<p>So what do all these citizen science projects tell us about how we should structure hackathons going forward &#8211; in short, we need to make room for science.</p>
<p>We need to rethink the typical weekend hackathon and the focus on building narrowly focused apps. We need to find structures that support the development of different ideas with longer term goals, that may not have a finished app that can be loaded in a web browser or pulled up on a mobile device at the end of a weekend. We need to encourage projects that are focused on collecting data, from all over our city, that can help us better understand how it works &#8211; data that can be used by others to conduct research, or build apps of their own.</p>
<p>This is starting to happen in Philly, and in other places as well. One notable example here is the upcoming <a href="http://www.phillyecocamp.org/">EcoCamp event</a> being sponsored by Azavea. It features a hackathon that is paired with an unconference and workshops &#8211; a pretty cool idea that I hope leads to some interesting citizen science projects. Code for Philly&#8217;s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-America-Philly/">weekly hack nights</a> have also been instrumental in helping these science projects move along the path to viability as well &#8211; another reason to love (and support) your local <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the standard weekend hackathon for building apps is going away. Just that we need to think clearly about the kind of events we want, and what we hope to get out of them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to more hackathons in Philly, and more citizen science projects.</p>

		<p>My time as the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s Chief Data Officer is <a href="../../../../2014/03/20/the-philadelphia-experiment/index.html">coming to an end</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an incredible experience &#8211; I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with a great team, and to have helped change the way that government officials think about open data and civic hacking. Before I move on to new things, however, I have a few more items I want to move into the &#8220;Done&#8221; column.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got one more week and three more things I want to get done.</p>
<p><strong>Integrating with Data.gov</strong></p>
<p>One of the things we&#8217;ve had on our radar for a while is getting the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s open data sets from <a href="http://OpenDataPhilly.org">OpenDataPhilly.org</a> listed in the <a href="https://www.data.gov/cities/community/cities/datasets">Cities community in the federal Data.gov site</a>. Currently, OpenDataPhilly.org is running an outdated version of the Open Data Catalog software &#8211; which has Data.gov integration built in &#8211; but a <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/data.gov">simple Node.js</a> script and the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/api-doc/">OpenDataPhilly API</a> make it pretty simple to generate the <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/">required metadata</a> file for listing our data sets there.</p>
<p>The metadata for our data now validates, and I&#8217;m hopeful that listings from OpenDataPhilly.org will appear in Data.gov this week &#8211; making it the first time listings from a community-managed site are listed in the national site for open data.</p>
<p><strong>Data on Professional Services Contracts</strong></p>
<p>For the past several months, we&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/INTEGRITYWORKS/who.html">Chief Integrity Officer</a> to open up data on <a href="https://trello.com/c/4qy1Aojj/54-city-contracts">professional services contracts</a> from city departments. Currently, information on professional services contracts is <a href="https://secure.phila.gov/econtract/">difficult to find</a>, and is provided only in PDF format.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of work has gone into generating comprehensive documentation for professional services contract data, as well as providing the data in a more usable format (as well as providing historical data going back several quarters). This work is close to being finished and I&#8217;m hopeful it will be launched in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Data on Lobbyist Registrations</strong></p>
<p>In addition, we&#8217;ve been working with the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/ethicsboard/Pages/default.aspx">Board of Ethics</a> as they implement a new lobbyist management system &#8211; this new system will allow individuals that act as lobbyist to register with the city and also submit their activity reports.</p>
<p>As part of this process, the Board of Ethics was gracious enough to allow us to consult on how open data could be integrated into their new system. They&#8217;ve been great to work with, and they recently rolled the first phase of this new system, which allows lobbyists to register &#8211; it also includes functionality which allows all registration information to be <a href="https://trello.com/c/XstFNMkl/91-lobbyist-registration">downloaded in CSV format</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working now to push out some comprehensive documentation for the lobbyist registration information CSV data &#8211; we hope to get this out before the end of the week.</p>
<p>Time is short, but there&#8217;s still lots to do.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>Three years ago next month, the City of Philadelphia&#8217;s open data portal was <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/04/25/data-crunched-all-that%E2%80%99s-needed-to-jump-start-an-open-data-movement-is-a-city-government-that-doesn%E2%80%99t-stand-in-the-way/">launched by local technology firm Azavea</a> as part of the inaugural Philly Tech Week. Two years ago next month, Philadelphia joined the small (but growing) fraternity of cities to adopt a formal open data policy &#8211; a milestone that stands as one of the first in something I think of as an &#8220;experiment&#8221; in municipal transparency. </p>
<p>Since this experiment first began, our open data efforts have come a very long way, and Philadelphia is now looked at as a national leader on open data and civic technology. In many ways it is now time for a new chapter in the Philadelphia experiment &#8211; our city is ready to take open data to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, though, it is time to step back and take a different role in the Philadelphia technology community and the broader open data effort &#8211; both here and in other places.</p>
<p><strong>How Far We&#8217;ve Come</strong></p>
<p>In the last several years, Philadelphia has grown into a national leader on open data and civic technology. We enthusiastically <a href="http://ph.ly/OpenDataGuide">share our experience and our ideas</a> with other municipalities that want to kick off their own open data experiment.</p>
<p>Our open data portal contains <a href="https://trello.com/b/iUUy84lK/city-of-philadelphia-open-data-pipeline">dozens of new data sets</a> added since the adoption of our open data policy, some released for the very first time by city government. The <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">OpenDataPhilly</a> platform has inspired <a href="http://www.opendatacincy.org/">efforts in other cities</a> that look to us as a model for how to implement their open data efforts.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObrlsMA7c3M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>We have embraced not only open data, but also open source software and we are actively <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia">sharing both our code and our data on platforms like GitHub</a> as a way to engage with the broader data community and tap into communities of innovators. The City of Philadelphia now has <a href="http://government.github.com/stories/philadelphia-gets-going-and-gets-open/">more public GitHub repos</a> than any other city in the country, and more are on the way.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re leading the discussion on the development of new <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-headd/how-technology-can-fight-the-flu_b_4495730.html">municipal data standards</a> that will help speed the adoption of other open data releases, and enhance the value of civic technology.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re finding innovative new ways to engage with local technology vendors by making <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/">opportunities for smaller technology projects more visible</a>. We&#8217;re <a href="../../../../2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/index.html">using GitHub</a> and other platforms to make responding to technology procurement opportunities easier, more engaging and more valuable.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="http://phlapi.com/">growing suite of developer-ready APIs</a> that can be used to quickly and easily create powerful new civic apps. And, most importantly, we&#8217;re collaborating with <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">one of the most active civic hacking communities in the country</a> and helping to enable the building of all sorts of <a href="http://www.phlcrimemapper.com/">new</a> <a href="http://lti.planphilly.com/">awesome</a> <a href="http://groundedinphilly.org/">apps</a>. </p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia is ready for the next chapter in its open data experiment. </p>
<p>The milestones that lay ahead will see the release of important new data sets that will enable more meaningful and more sustainable <a href="http://ph.ly/DiscussPhillyData">civic engagement in our city</a>. These new data releases and APIs will also help create the foundation for unprecedented collaboration between city departments and other governments. No force has more potential to enable <a href="../../../../2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/index.html">significant improvements in government efficiency and operations</a> than open data.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be watching all of this unfold from a new vantage point &#8211; as a member (once again) of the Philly technology and civic hacking communities. In early April, I&#8217;ll step down from my post as Chief Data Officer and return to being a professional technologist. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking more in the weeks ahead about exactly what I&#8217;ll be doing, but I&#8217;ll still be working with governments and open data. I&#8217;ll also still be in Philly &#8211; my wife and I will continue to live and work here, and our kids will still go to school here.</p>
<p>It has truly been an honor and a privilege to serve this great city, and I owe a debt of gratitude to Managing Director Rich Negrin and CIO Adel Abeid for the opportunity. I look forward to continuing to do so going forward, but from outside city government.</p>
<p>Philly&#8217;s open data effort has always been bigger than any one person &#8211; it&#8217;s always been about the community. It&#8217;s now time for me to rejoin that community.</p>
<p>See you at the next <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/events/hackathons/">hackathon</a>.</p>

		<p>Governments make a wealth of data available on their public websites.</p>
<p>Forward thinking governments have take steps to ensure that more and more of this information is available in <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#open-formats">open formats</a>. But the majority of the data available on government websites &#8211; even those with formal open data policies, like Philadelphia &#8211; is not open. It is merely &#8220;public.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What is Public Data?</strong></p>
<p><em>Public data</em> is available for viewing, typically as an HTML page (or series of pages), a PDF document or in some similar format suitable for publishing on the web. It is meant to be consumed by eyeballs, not by computer programs or applications.</p>
<p>It is possible to access public data in a programatic fashion through the use of scraping tools that are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2861/options-for-html-scraping">available in most programming languages</a>, through services like <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/">ScraperWiki</a> or even using something as simple as <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/3093339">Google Docs</a>.</p>
<p>However, writing web scrapers &#8211; even though the technology options for doing so have advanced tremendously in recent years &#8211; is tedious and the notion is unappealing to most data users. In addition, there are a number of reasons why making important data available solely as public data is undesirable.</p>
<p><strong>An Example: Scraping Tax Balance Data</strong></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R3bVoBgLHm8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve never met the person that recorded the screencast above, but data on property tax balances in Philadelphia was important enough to them to invest the time to write a data scraper. (This data currently only exists as public data &#8211; viewable one record at a time &#8211; on the web site of the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/realestatetax/">Philadelphia Department of Revenue</a>.)</p>
<p>The screencast this individual recorded and posted to YouTube serves as a strong indicator that this data should be prioritized for release by the City of Philadelphia as open data. Until it is made available in this way, more people will be forced to obtain this important data by writing scrapers, or through <a href="http://www.phila.gov/privacy/pdfs/FinalCityOpenRecords.pdf">alternate channels</a>.</p>
<p>Property tax data is an ideal example to illustrate the problems of public data in the context of a city that has a formal open data policy. It meets every conceivable definition of the term &#8220;high value&#8221; data &#8211; the fact that external users go out of their way to write data scrapers should be enough to confirm this.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a strong correlation between <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2013/03/09/part-one-lax-property-tax-enforcement-and-brazen-deadbeat-investors-have-depressed-philadelphia-s-property-tax-base-by-9-5-billion">tax delinquency and vacant properties</a>, and research is currently underway at Rutgers University&#8217;s School of Criminal Justice on the relationship between tax delinquency and the incidence of serious crimes in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>This is data that people want so that they may better understand how their city works, and may explore ways that they can make it work better.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations</strong></p>
<p>High value data that is only made available as public data presents a number of problems for both data users, and for governments that produce such data.</p>
<p>Forcing people to employ web scrapers places an unneeded barrier in front of what should be open data. Furthermore, it limits the number of users that can access such data &#8211; not all data users are technically sophisticated enough to create and use web scrapers. Even for those who are, writing scrapers is almost never desirable &#8211; it&#8217;s tedious, can be very time consuming and most scrapers are brittle pieces of technology that get thrown away once the desired data is obtained.</p>
<p>For governments, the problems created by web scraping can be significant. Scrapers can place an unnecessary burden on IT infrastructure &#8211; disrupting normal operations and causing problems for more mainstream data users (those that may want to view data one record at a time). When inelegantly designed scrapers send non-trivial amounts of web traffic to a government site, it can create problems that IT staff must identify and troubleshoot. This wastes value staff time on problems that are easily avoided.</p>
<p>In addition, by failing to make data available in more easily consumable formats governments might be missing opportunities to use such data to <a href="../../../../2014/01/02/2014-the-year-of-open-data/index.html">improve their own operations</a>. What if every interaction with city government by a taxpayer (a citizen or a business &#8211; residents &amp; nonresidents alike) could include an API call to check for outstanding property taxes?</p>
<p>Open data can make such an operational improvement a reality &#8211; by making data more accessible and more usable for the public, governments also make data more usable by their own operating units.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Considerations</strong></p>
<p>But the strongest criticisms of public data derive from the principles that guide most open data policies &#8211; including the <a href="https://gist.github.com/PhillyCDO/3623582">City of Philadelphia&#8217;s policy</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;agencies shall publish information on line (in addition to other planned or mandated publication methods), and in an open format. The open format will provide data in a form that can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, searched and reused by commonly used web search applications and software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Making valuable data &#8220;public&#8221; but not &#8220;open&#8221; is a departure from the principles outlined in most open data policies. Some more cynical observers have suggested that it is a way for government officials to lay claim to the ideals of open data while ensuring that information remains difficult to use for serious analysis. This may be why the vast majority of campaign finance and lobbying information published by governments is made available in PDF format only.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>Any government that has a formal open data policy should target and prioritize data that is being scraped for release as open data. In the absence of such a prioritization, we may struggle to meet our objectives for openness and government transparency, we may miss real opportunities to improve government operations and we are likely creating avoidable problems for our IT staff and technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>Clean, well documented, public APIs accompanied by static data downloads should be the standard we strive for with public data releases of high value data.</p>
<p>[Note &#8211; In December, 2015 (almost 2 years after I wrote this post and began working inside the City of Philadelphia to release property tax balance data) the city <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/property-tax-balances">released this data as open data</a>.]</p>

						<a href="../../../../2014/01/10/onboarding-civic-hackers/index.html"><span class="posted-on"><span class="screen-reader-text">Posted on </span><time class="entry-date published" datetime="January 10, 2014"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i>January 10, 2014</time></span></a> <span class="byline">by <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../../../author/mheadd/index.html">mheadd</a></span></span>		</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of attending a civic hacking event jointly organized by <a href="http://codeforphilly.org/">Code for Philly</a> and <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/philadelphia">Girl Develop It Philly</a>. The event had a tremendously good turnout &#8211; over 50 people by my count &#8211; making it one of the larger events Code for Philly has organized in recent months.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cfa_gdi.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="cfa_gdi" width="300" height="225" style="float:right;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>The mission of Girl Develop It is to empower women to learn software development, and as a result there were a good number of people at the event being introduced to civic hacking for the first time. This got me thinking about ways to onboard people new to civic hacking (and people new to coding) into civic technology projects.</p>
<p>None of these is new, but here are five ideas I came up with after the event:</p>
<p><strong>Data Liberation</strong> &#8211; the foundation of civic hacking project is open data, and far too much of the data civic hackers need is locked up in broken websites and unusable formats. Helping to <a href="http://pdfliberation.wordpress.com/">break some of this data free</a> can be a tremendous benefit to open data users and civic hacking projects.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong> &#8211; far too many open source and civic hacking projects go without proper documentation to help other developers contribute and to support end users. Helping to create or expand documentation for a project can be critical to helping it succeed.</p>
<p><strong>User Testing</strong> &#8211; Organizing and conducting end user testing for civic technology projects is sadly rare. There are some <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/introducing-the-cut-group-get-paid-to-test-civic-apps/">efforts underway to change this</a> but in order for civic hacking projects to improve and succeed we need real feedback from mainstream users.</p>
<p><strong>Outreach</strong> &#8211; One legitimate criticism of civic apps is that too few people know they exist. There are efforts working to change this, like <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/">Apps for Philly</a> (still in its infancy) &#8211; a site that lists a host of different civic technology apps that are available for users. Adding new projects to this listing (and others like it) will both help these projects succeed and give the person doing it a much clearer sense of the civic technology landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Helper Libraries</strong> &#8211; a great way to get comfortable writing code and to help out a civic technology project is to write <a href="http://phlapi.com/libraries.html">helper libraries</a> for projects with APIs. At the Apps for Philly <a href="http://appsforphilly.org/events/transit-2013">Transit Hackathon</a>, one project utilized recently released data from the City of Philadelphia on bicycle thefts. The lead developer created a <a href="http://bikethefts.jeffsbox.net/">new API for this data</a> to enable other projects to use it. Building new client libraries in a range of different languages would be a great way to support other developers that want to incorporate bike theft data into their projects, and to get some hands on experience writing code.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to contribute to open source projects and to help support civic hacking efforts &#8211; these are just a few.</p>
<p>We need more great events like the one organized by Code for Philly and Girl Develop it Philly to bring together all of the talented people we have in our city to work on these important projects.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>2013 was <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/12/20/the-year-in-local-open-data/">a big year</a> for municipal open data, but I think 2014 will be even bigger.</p>
<p>Last year saw the development of an interesting dialog on open data focused on the proper goals for government open data programs. With their roots in transparency efforts, a growing number of people observed that open data programs seemed to be <a href="../../../../2013/06/20/keeping-the-faith-on-open-data/index.html">moving away from their primary objectives</a> &#8211; making government more accountable &#8211; and gravitating toward other goals like economic development and <a href="http://www.opendata500.com/">promoting entrepreneurship</a>.</p>
<p>And while this is a highly valuable discussion to have, I think an even more important discussion is brewing &#8211; a discussion about the role that open data will play in fostering innovation and change inside government.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="../../../../2013/06/22/why-publish-open-data/index.html">touched on this subject before</a>, but I think that open data has almost limitless potential to change the way the governments themselves work. In fact, I believe that nothing has the potential to drive more innovation inside of government than open data programs originally designed to share data with consumers outside of government.</p>
<p><strong>The Bezos Mandate</strong></p>
<p>Steve Yegge&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">famous rant about Amazon.com</a> provided some invaluable insights into how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> turned Amazon the book seller into the company that runs a large portion of the Internet. In a nutshell, Bezos told his employees at Amazon that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">services</a> would be the way that different parts of the organization communicated going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</li>
<li>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</li>
<li>There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team&#8217;s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols &#8212; doesn&#8217;t matter. Bezos doesn&#8217;t care.</li>
<li>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be <strong>externalizable</strong>. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</li>
<li>Anyone who doesn&#8217;t do this will be fired.</li>
<li>Thank you; have a nice day!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea that the service interfaces created and used inside the company had to be designed with the ability to make them available publicly has been a key to Amazon&#8217;s success. The relevant parallel for open data is that we are starting to see a similar trend emerge in governments that have mature open data programs &#8211; <a href="http://phlapi.com/">data and APIs</a> created for external consumption are increasingly becoming valuable as operational assets for other parts of government.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government, so it is often the case that what should be easy isn&#8217;t. Could we condition the denial of a permit from city government on whether a person has an outstanding tax liability, an outstanding parking ticket, a violation against a property they own, or an outstanding utility bill? Doing this requires querying data sets that fall under the purview of an array of different departments and agencies across the government footprint. It also requires the development of systems that integrate all this data and allow it to be used as part of a well defined process.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a Culture of Sharing</strong></p>
<p>There are at least three good reasons why open data helps enable these kinds of changes within municipal governments.</p>
<p>First, open data programs make data <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/">discoverable</a> &#8211; it obviates the need for special relationships or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use, so few resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>Second, open data programs make data more usable &#8211; they create incentives for governments to describe their data for people that are not domain experts, and to build <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/government?apicat=Government">services</a> for easier and more efficient use of data.</p>
<p>Third, open data programs create a &#8220;culture of sharing&#8221; within government. As noted in a <a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/annual_report_2013.pdf">recently released data analytics report</a> from the City of New York &#8211;<em> Aggregating cross-agency data is often first a political, legal, and cultural discussion</em>. Whether created by statute, executive order or some other vehicle, open data directives send a clear message to the bureaucracy that data sharing is not only beneficial, but expected.</p>
<p>Government open data flips the Bezos Mandate around by encouraging the development of service interfaces that are &#8220;internalizable,&#8221; and can drive innovation inside of government. By creating data resources (downloads and API) for external consumption, open data programs make data immensely more usable inside government.</p>
<p><strong>Frictionless Data Drives Innovation</strong></p>
<p>The many benefits to internal government innovation from external open data depend on how successful governments are in making their data useful to outside consumers. Data that is complete, updated, well documented and available via an API is more likely to be used.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/12/how-apis-fuel-innovation/">private sector companies driving innovation through the use of APIs</a>, and plenty of examples of governments that need to <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2013/12/30/data-user-experience/">step up their game</a>. We have <a href="../../../../2013/09/17/the-lesson-of-pennapps/index.html">a lot more work to do</a> in order to make the use of government data frictionless.</p>
<p>There is an amazingly powerful dynamic at work within properly constructed open data programs &#8211; the more useful we make open data for users outside of government, the more potential we have to drive innovation and efficiencies inside of government.</p>

		<blockquote><p>This season, influenza activity started about 4 weeks early and was intense. Influenza-like-illness rose quickly to well above the baseline of expected activity and remained elevated for 15 consecutive weeks, making this season slightly longer than average.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2012-2013-flu-season-wrapup.htm">2012-2013 Flu Season Wrap Up</a>, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">When open data and an acute problem meet, great civic apps are often born.</p>
<p>Last year in Chicago, the acute problem was the more severe than anticipated flu season and the powerful civic app it helped to foster was <a href="https://github.com/tkompare/chicagoflushots">Chicago Flu Shots</a> by software developer <a href="http://about.me/tomkompare">Tom Kompare</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developed for the Chicago Department of Public Health, Kompare’s flu shot finder was incorporated into the City’s official web site and served as the flagship application for helping Chicagoans quickly and easily find locations near them where flu shots were being dispensed. As important as this was, the Chicago Flu Shots app would go on to have an even broader impact &#8211; beyond the borders of the City of Chicago &#8211; before the raging flu season had ended.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/flu-shots.jpg?w=187&#038;h=250" alt="flu-shots" width="187" height="250" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Making it quick and easy to find a location that dispenses flu vaccinations is an ideal problem for a civic app to help solve.  Information on flu shot locations and schedules can be easily displayed via a web site, mobile app, or even via SMS, and can be easily integrated into a personal calendar or reminder app. In addition, data on where flu vaccinations are dispensed are usually compiled &#8211; albeit in widely differing formats &#8211; by local public health officials.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the more vexing challenges facing public health officials during flu season is not just making people aware of the availability of vaccinations but also getting people to follow through and receive them. It’s far too easy for many of us to continually delay receiving vaccinations because of perceived inconvenience. Not only does Chicago Flu Shots display the location where vaccinations are being dispensed, it also shows details like cost, eligibility and hours of operations, and even provided directions from the user’s location to the facility dispensing vaccinations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several weeks after being implemented in Chicago, Chicago Flu Shots &#8211; which Kompare made freely available on the code sharing site GitHub &#8211; was “forked” and implemented in Boston. Then in Philadelphia. In each successive instance where it was implemented, local developers used data obtained from the new host city’s public health agency. What started out as a notable civic app for its high profile use in Chicago went on to become a prime example of the potential impact of civic software development and open data for cities across the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lesson for municipal leaders and advocates of open data became clear &#8211; make it easier for civic app developers in different cities to implement a new solution and it will quickly spread from city to city. The one significant impediment to possible wider implementation of Chicago Flu Shots last year was the lack of readily available data in more cities, and the lack of a consistent format for developers to use to more quickly implement it in their home town.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the most powerful aspects of civic software development is the potential for reuse of these applications in multiple cities that may face similar challenges, or where similar kinds of open data are available. This principle lies behind efforts like the <a href="http://commons.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Commons</a> and the <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which is now active in over 30 cities in the U.S and international in Poland, Ireland and Japan. As with the Chicago Flu Shots app, one of the most significant impediments to realizing this potential is the availability of consistently formatted data across jurisdictions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Open data advocates can help foster the creation of civic apps that can be shared across cities by working toward the development of shared data standards and APIs. These shared standards can help make civic apps “plug and play” &#8211; cities that make the same data available in the same format can quickly and easily adopt civic apps built in other places. The Open311 specification is a great example of a data standard that has been adopted in multiple cities and helped to foster the creation of apps like the <a href="http://311labs.org/experiments/dailybrief">311 Daily Brief</a> and City if Bloomington, Indiana’s <a href="https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/uReport">uReport 311 app</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In response to the experience of last flu season, open data leaders in several large cities came together under the auspices of the Code for America <a href="http://peernetwork.in/">Peer Network</a> to develop a data specification for flu shot locations. Such a standard, it is believed, will help bolster the reuse of apps like Chicago Flu Shots that can be used to find nearby locations where flu vaccinations are dispensed, no matter which city you live in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="http://cityofphiladelphia.github.io/flu-shot-spec/">draft data specification</a> has since been developed to the point that it is ready for initial adoption, and several large cities including <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/flu-shot-spec/tree/master/city-of-philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/developers/docs/flu-shot-clinic-locations-2013">Chicago</a> and <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Health/San-Francisco-Department-of-Public-Health-Flu-Shot/acja-ak3a">San Francisco</a> are now using this data specification to make their flu slot location available for public use. The specification itself is on GitHub and is open for anyone to make suggestions for enhancements or changes &#8211; the goal is to continue to develop and refine this specification as it gets adopted in more cities and becomes more widely used by civic app developers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hope in developing this data specification and implementing it in large cities is that it will foster the creation of new applications that raise awareness about the availability of flu shots and make it easier for people to find locations where shots are dispensed. The aim is nothing short of marshaling the growing army of civic hackers in cities across the country the to try and make this flu season less severe than the last.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether the 2013-2014 flu season will be as severe as the previous year remains to be seen. What we do know is that civic app developers in cities across the country will be better equipped than before the help mitigate the problem by leveraging a new standard for data on flu shot locations.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about a way to describe what I have seen happening in the world of open data over the past few years, where outside developers create new applications and solutions built with government data to provide a service or transaction that might otherwise be provided by a government agency (or not provided at all). I&#8217;ve taken to describing this phenomenon as &#8220;exoproduction.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Exoproduction</strong> of public services can be said to occur when all or part of a service typically provided by a government or a public sector entity occurs outside of, or exogenous to, the agency of government explicitly (or implicitly) charged with providing that service, or a component of it.</p>
<p>While governments do not directly provide services or information in scenarios where exoproduction occurs, they do make available the raw materials or components necessary for the service to be provided by a third party.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The clearest example of this phenomenon can be observed when looking at information on transit services. Transit authorities are charged with operating and maintaining public transit systems, and as part of their responsibilities they are charged with communicating to current and prospective transit riders the schedules for transit services, the fares for such services and even the current status of various transit assets (e.g., is the R3 train running on time?).</p>
<p>However, through <a href="http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/">deliberate programs</a> designed to share the raw data on transit schedules and real time location information many transit agencies are encouraging the development of third-party applications and solutions that fill this role. A non-trivial and growing number of transit riders <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">obtain information on transit services</a> from a source that is outside the official purview or control of transit authorities.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of other examples where outside parties develop solutions on top of government provided or maintained data &#8211; to fill a role or address an issue that would logically fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. In Philadelphia, there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">repurposing of vacant properties</a>, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to <a href="http://www.phila.gov/pra/about.html">specific government agencies</a>. These outside efforts are enabled by the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/search/?sort=name&amp;dir=asc&amp;qs=property&amp;filter=data">deliberate release of property information</a> by the City of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the past I&#8217;ve used the term &#8220;coproduction&#8221; to refer to this phenomenon, but that term has several decades worth of history behind it and more correctly refers to another scenario where outside actors impact how a government service is provided. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coproduction_(public_services)">Coproduction</a> assumes that the direct recipients (or consumers) of a government service are involved in making a service more effective or delivered more efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, community policing services may be improved by interacting with residents in a neighborhood. Through these interactions, police may gain insights and information that help them develop better strategies for crime prevention and ultimately provide better service to the community. </p>
<p>Exoproduction differs from this because it frequently involves the development of solutions by those that are not the direct recipient of services. For example, the development of <a href="http://sheltr.org/">an application to find homeless shelters</a> built by a group of young professional at a hackathon.</p>
<p>Government agencies have a variety of strategies for leveraging outside parties to provide direct services to citizens and to fulfill their missions. Most people are familiar with the example of governments using the <a href="http://secure.phila.gov/econtract/">standard procurement process</a> to buy services from outside parties. Many of the technology solutions that are used by governments to provide services and information directly to citizens are built by (or with the help of) outside businesses. </p>
<p>Social service and mental health services may also be provided by outside parties like neighborhood-based agencies or church groups. Some cities have &#8220;business improvement districts&#8221; with <a href="http://www.centercityphila.org/">special authorities</a> established with quasi taxing authority to support things like trash pickup, graffiti removal and security. The list goes on.</p>
<p>However, each of these examples involves the direct oversight or control of government through a formal contract, or through enabling legislation. We need a new definition for what we see happening in the world of open data and civic technology, where the oversight or approval role of government is less direct. </p>
<p>In the more traditional examples above, governments typically provide money &#8211; through a formal contracting process &#8211; to outside parties to act as a proxy on behalf of government for the delivery of a service. With exoproduction, the currency used to drive service delivery is (typically) data.</p>
<p>Having said that, It should be noted that exoproduction may not only occur when software and technology solutions get built on top of government open data &#8211; there are some analog examples where exoproduction can take place. For example, food that is provided to support needy children may be provided through various government programs but is actually dispensed by private individuals outside of public facilities. There is a <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-16/news/33217460_1_prattis-lunch-program-archdiocesan-program">notable example of this</a> from the Philadelphia area that also demonstrates some of the potential challenges with the shift to exoproduction.</p>
<blockquote><p>
A Delaware County woman who voluntarily distributes free food to children from her driveway has run afoul of officials in Chester Township who say her efforts violate zoning ordinances.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this instance, a woman distributing food to needy children through a state-sponsored program administered by a local archdiocese ran afoul of local zoning ordinances. In a way, the issues encountered in this example might be viewed as analogous to <a href="http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post/3263/new-york-mta-threatens-blogger-asserts-copyright-over-schedule/">those encountered by a software developer</a> that scrapes data from public website in order to support a civic application. Actions supported (either directly or tacitly) by one arm of government might encounter resistance from another. </p>
<p>Questions remain about how exoproduction will ultimately impact the way that governments deliver services.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">Will solutions developed via exoproduction augment or replace the service provided by government, or relieve governments of the responsibility of providing a service themselves?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:5px;">How do we measure the impact or effectiveness of exoproduced solutions, and how does (or how should) this impact how government agencies with official responsibility for providing a service be evaluated?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:15px;">How does (or how should) exoproduction impact the way we budget for or procure solutions through outside parties?</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that open data and the phenomenon of exoproduction (or whatever we decide to call it) have the potential to fundamentally change the way that public services are delivered. As governments continue to implement open data programs, it would be worth considering these questions and others that will impact how externally developed solutions are used to improve our communities.</p>

	<div class="entry-summary">
		<p>The Wall Street Journal recently featured <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324263404578613850076916028.html">an awesome story about civic hacking</a>, focusing on the amazing work being done in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the efforts of civic hackers and open data advocates covered in the mainstream press, and the team in Chicago &#8211; those both inside and outside of city government &#8211; deserve every bit of praise they get for their tremendous efforts. But I did take issue with one point made in the article &#8211; interestingly, one made in the very first sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Cash-strapped cities are turning to an unusual source to improve their online services on the cheap: helpful hackers, who use city data to create tools tracking everything from real-time subway delays to where to get a free flu shot near your home and information about a contentious school-closing plan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would argue the the fiscal pressure faced by governments &#8211; particularly cities &#8211; hasn&#8217;t helped encourage officials to experiment with new ways to provide services and information, and helped highlight the need for technology innovation. However, I don&#8217;t think its accurate to say that what is happening is an effort by governments to get IT work done by outsiders &#8220;on the cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about building things cheaper, its about building them better. </p>
<p>Implicit in the idea of &#8220;government as a platform&#8221; and the factors that help to drive municipal open data programs is that the <a href="../../../../2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/index.html">role of governments in the delivery of public services is changing</a> &#8211; toward the role of data steward or API manager, and away from the more traditional role of &#8220;app builder.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the role of data steward is a better one for governments &#8211; most importantly, governments don&#8217;t typically make good bets on technology. They&#8217;re <a href="../../../../2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/index.html">not set up to do it properly</a>, and as a result its not uncommon to see governments invest in technology that quickly becomes out of date and difficult to manage. This problem is particularly acute in relation to web-based services and applications &#8211; which outside civic technologists are very good at building &#8211; the landscape for developing these kinds of applications changes far too rapidly for governments to realistically stay current.</p>
<p>Governments that focus on becoming data stewards are better able to break out of the cycle of investing in technology that quickly becomes out of date. It is these governments that are <a href="http://phlapi.com/">moving to release open data and deploy APIs</a> to enable outside developers to build applications that can help deliver services and information to citizens. </p>
<p>However, this shift to the role of data steward doesn&#8217;t deobligate governments from investing in technology or skilled staff. It simply means that this investment can be focused within a role that governments are better structured to perform well. Developing the infrastructure and policies to support an open data program and API platform are not necessarily &#8220;cheaper&#8221; but they are a much better technology investment for governments to make.</p>
<p>In another sense, the move to the co-production of technology solutions with outside developers is also about building better applications as opposed to building cheaper ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s common for those behind civic technology projects to have <a href="https://recovers.org/about">personal investment in the issues being addressed by their solutions</a>. These developers bring a different perspective to the problems that, in the past, may only have been addressed by governments &#8211; they are stakeholders in the success of our cities.</p>
<p>Engaging outside developers and marshaling the efforts of civic hackers to build new tools and new services to improve our communities is about enhancing the quality of solutions, and <strong>not</strong> lowering their cost. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the awareness of civic hacking and the open data efforts that fuel it getting coverage in the mainstream press. But we still have a ways to go on communicating the more fundamental changes to government this movement entails, and the real benefits we all stand to gain.</p>

Openness in government strengthens our democracy, promotes the delivery of efficient and effective services to the public, and contributes to economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Federal Executive Order on Open Data</a>, Section 1.
</p></blockquote>
<p>People in the open government community talk a lot about the potential and promise of open data. The things that it might enable. The problems it might help fix. The possibilities. </p>
<p>Each new instance where we see open data get used to address a problem facing a city or a community is a testament to its true power, and a validation of the work governments do to open it up and make it usable. When we see open data get put to use in the way that we envision it, it can be a very gratifying thing. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">new website in Philadelphia</a> focused on the challenge of unused vacant land demonstrates how open data is supposed to work. It&#8217;s built using a variety of <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/about/our-data/">data sources made available by the City of Philadelphia</a>, and it allows people to discover vacant land in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://thepossiblecity.com/lotxlot/">isn&#8217;t the first web site</a> to aggregate data on vacant land in Philadelphia, which underscores how <a href="http://planphilly.com/articles/2012/03/13/philadelphias-imminent-vacant-land-plan-major-progress-or-major-letdown">pressing an issue</a> it is for our city. One of the things I like most about the site is how it frames information about vacant land with an eye toward reuse. The site tells you the planing and zoning district a property is in, as well as the City Council district.</p>
<p>It tells you if there is a structure on the property by checking it against the city&#8217;s Stormwater Billing system, and if a user thinks it might be suitable to convert into a community garden there are <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/resources/">resources available</a> to assist.</p>
<p>Want to watch a specific property, or <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/organize/">organize neighbors</a> around it? Want to improve the data by <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/lots/31595/photos/add/">uploading a photo</a>, or indicating whether something is reported incorrectly? Want to purchase a property through a <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/pathways/sheriff-sale/">Sheriff Sale</a> or through an arrangement with a private owner? The site has information and resources to assist with all of these.</p>
<p>The site even hints at where the City of Philadelphia should go next with it&#8217;s open data efforts. One of the data sources used by the site is an <a href="http://api.phillyaddress.com/">independently built API</a> for property information. The data powering this API is actually scraped from the City&#8217;s website because it is not currently available as a data download or through a city-owned API. This is something we are currently working to change, but the fact that this site makes use of scraped data underscores the need for the City of Philadelphia to release this data in a more open format.</p>
<p>This site is everything that advocates of open data hope for when they work to make data more readily available and to provide <a href="http://phlapi.com/">documentation on how to use it</a>. What&#8217;s most interesting about it is that not once did the sponsors or developers interact with City IT staff while building it. Data that is truly open means that users don&#8217;t need to ask for permission before they use it, or for instructions on how to use it. </p>
<p>Open data works best when it is readily available for those that need it, to build useful services and apps that help address the challenges facing our communities.</p>
<p>This is the way that open data is supposed to work. </p>
