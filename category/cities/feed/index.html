										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

<p id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve had the opportunity recently to talk to people in several different city governments that are facing a common challenge — <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">how to liberate operational data from a legacy system</span>.</p>
<p id="fdb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a challenge that lots of city governments face, and it strikes me that there are some common lessons that can be derived from cities that have gone down this road already for those that are still trying to figure out the right approach.</p>
<p id="0867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following suggestions are crafted from my own experience as a municipal government official charged with making data more widely available, and those of people in similar positions that I’ve had a chance to speak with.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4739"></span></p>
<p id="538a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope this helps someone in a city government that is currently facing this challenge.</p>
<h3 id="a933" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem</h3>
<p id="08fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’ve got operational data in a legacy system that you want to make more easily available to users inside of (and outside of) your city government.</p>
<p id="8565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may be a part of a larger data or analytics strategy that is spinning up, or a one-off request from the Mayor or other political leader for a specific project. Regardless of how it landed in your lap, the job is yours now.</p>
<p id="9a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">You’ve got to figure out the best way to provide access to data in a legacy system in a way that is both useful for others and maintainable by you</span>.</p>
<h3 id="fde9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Some Hurdles You’ll Face</h3>
<p id="0982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You probably won’t have additional resources allocated to support this project, and if the system in question is a bespoke solution created by a vendor they may want to charge you a handsome sum to do the work for you.</p>
<p id="e88e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is one of the first projects you’re undertaking to get operational data out of a legacy system for other purposes, you may not have a lot of the policy and technology infrastructure in place to support what you want to do. In a way this is a good thing — you have a greenfield opportunity to help shape policy and set up infrastructure that can be used to support a broader data strategy for your city. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to figure out what you need to get the job done on your own. As issues or questions arise, It will be your job to figure out how to address them.</p>
<p id="ca37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, you’ll have to make some definite choices technology wise. The good news is there are lots of different options for liberating data in legacy systems, and many are low cost and leverage open source software. However, different solutions may require different levels of technical expertise — some or all of which may be absent from your current IT environment. You’ll need to figure out how to introduce some new tools to your environment and — hopefully — keep them aligned with the skill sets of your staff and consistent with established IT policies.</p>
<p id="f1a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With these challenges in mind, here is a description of one approach that cities are using to take data from a legacy system and make it more easily usable by people inside and outside city government.</p>
<h3 id="548b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Extract, Transform, Load</h3>
<p id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first step in liberating data from a legacy system is to make a copy of it.</p>
<p id="a382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This seems pretty straightforward but it’s worth emphasizing as you consider how to get started. The use of your data for analytics and other purposes should occur outside of the environment your legacy system is currently running in.</p>
<p id="7b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your goal here is to make a separate copy of your production data that is stored outside of the production system that is using it. You want this copy to be as close to identical to your production data as possible (with the caveat that there there may be data in your legacy system that is not appropriate to share, or that is unable to be shred because of existing policy). And since regular usage of your production system will cause your copy to become stale over time, you want to make the process of generating a copy repeatable at regular (preferable short) intervals.</p>
<p id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sequence of steps is generally referred to in the world of data management as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). It’s a common need and there are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to do it well. That said, it can be difficult to cut through the noise around ETL, sift through the competing options, and select an approach or solution that is affordable and maintainable. Additionally, for governments that have a heterogeneous technology environment with lots of different legacy systems, more than one ETL approach may be required.</p>
<p id="0e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluating the ETL lifecycle in reverse can be a helpful way work through the issues:</p>
<h4 id="7cb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Load</h4>
<p id="ab7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Where are you going to put your data once you get it out of your legacy system?</p>
<p id="38fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational database platform (RDBMS) of some flavor probably makes the most sense. You can use an RDBMS with a whole bunch of commercially available reporting tools, and an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://redash.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increasing</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/ankane/blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">number</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.cluvio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud-based</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> tools. You can also use it to build an API (more on this below).</p>
<p id="f75b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Already got a database environment and licenses? You’re probably good to go. If not, think about where you’re going to house your data (on a machine racked in your data center, or somewhere in the cloud) and select a database solution that is a good fit for your current IT environment and employee’s skill sets.</p>
<h4 id="6173" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transform</h4>
<p id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The amount of transformation you’ll need to do on your data before loading it will depend on the system it is coming from. If your legacy data is already in an RDBMS you might be able to skip over this step and simply replicate from your production database to a backup.</p>
<p id="647a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, particularly if your data is in an older legacy system, you may need to extract it into an intermediate format (e.g., CSV) and alter it before loading it into another database. This is almost always a pretty solid approach — there are lots of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tools</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/scripts/csvsql.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a> for managing and manipulating these kinds of files, and for loading them into an RDBMS. These tools are scriptable and can be automated, making them easy to drop into your ETL toolchain.</p>
<p id="41d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If extracts from your legacy system are initially going to be infrequent (once a month or once a week) then you may be able to work through this process manually at first. As extracts become more frequent, you can start automating it incrementally, with the goal of having regular, frequent extracts occurring in a completed automated way.</p>
<h4 id="c169" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extract</h4>
<p id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the part of the ETL process that you don’t get to choose. Your data is in the system that it’s in — your challenge is to get it out of that system in a way that won’t disrupt its current operation and that is maintainable by you and/or other city IT staff.</p>
<p id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your data is already in an RDBMS, then there are undoubtedly utilities available to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replicate</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sqlserverdump.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backup</a> data (hopefully you are already using them). You should evaluate these options to decide which is best given your current scenario.</p>
<p id="9240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It your data is in an older system like an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/industry_insiders/2008/10/01/sql-server-using-ssis-to-retrieve-data-from-as400/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AS/400</a> or a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3438/importing-mainframe-data-with-sql-server-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mainframe system</a>, you may need to create a custom solution for extracting data. If you have vendors supporting these systems, you can inquire about potential approaches and pricing. But keep in mind — these systems are pretty common in municipal government. Your counterparts in other local governments face this same challenge and some have already figured out how to do it efficiently. Communicating with other government IT officials might be one of your most effective mechanism for extracting data from older legacy systems.</p>
<p id="ef6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve identified an ETL approach that works for you, you will have a copy of your production data in a separate system that is now ready to use. Depending on who wants to use this data, and how they want to use it, you’ll have several options for what to do next.</p>
<h3 id="fbe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Making Use of Your Data</h3>
<p id="47a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Replicating production data so that people in operation and policy offices can run reports is a pretty common use case. If this was the driver for liberating your data from a legacy system, then most of what remains is simply pointing your reporting tool of choice at your newly created database.</p>
<p id="2d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if you want to enable other uses for your data — e.g., using it to support a custom dashboard or application — or if you’re not sure what all of the uses for your data will be — you have some more decisions to make.</p>
<p id="362b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option that you have is to put your data in an open data platform. If your data liberation work is part of a larger effort to make data more accessible to external users, you may already have one of these (or you may soon be getting one). If not, then you can still use an open data platform to house your data for use in internal reporting, analytics and application development. There are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/10/open-data-portal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots of commercial and open source options</a> that can be run both on premise and in the cloud.</p>
<p id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to create an API for your data. This will allow you to tailor the way that users can access the data in a way that most effectively matches their use case. This option will, however, require you to make some technology choices.</p>
<p id="78f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every modern programming language has frameworks for building APIs, and odds are that you’ve already got some APIs running in your current IT environment (even if you didn’t build them). If your IT organization is a Microsoft shop (which is pretty common in municipal government), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">there are</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">great</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">options</a> for you to use to build an API. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform provides some nice options for hosting your data or your API application, as well as for <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p id="1a3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluate the options that most closely align with your current environment and that are a good fit for the talents of your existing IT staff, because odds are they are the ones that will have to manage it going forward.</p>
<h3 id="dbc6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Comes Next?</h3>
<p id="ff5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Whether you’ve put your data in an open data portal or created a standalone API, you now have an interface that you can manage that allows people to access your data. There are a few things you’ll need to think about to manage it effectively in the long run:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="aa24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who gets to use your API? Will they be required to authenticate to use it, or provide a key with calls to your API?</li>
<li id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you open up access to your API to a select group of users (e.g., those on your internal network, or at a specific IP range) or will it be available more broadly, for anyone to use?</li>
<li id="8d13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you manage traffic to your API to prevent abuse or overuse by specific users?</li>
<li id="cd97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you monitor your API to ensure it is up and operating properly?</li>
<li id="170f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you log requests to your API and do regular diagnostics?</li>
</ul>
<p id="c71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond general management of your API, (whether you realize it or not) you’re also going to need to provide some support for users of your API:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Will you provide examples to users for how they can make calls and get data from your API?</li>
<li id="5586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who do users contact if they are having a problem using your API?</li>
<li id="8a6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where do users go to ask questions, or learn more about how to use your API?</li>
<li id="723f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will users (internal or external) be able to suggest changes or enhancements to your API?</li>
</ul>
<p id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot to consider for a project that you may not have explicitly chosen to undertake in the first place.</p>
<p id="657b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re working with a vendor that has provided an open data portal, many of the things listed above may be in place already. And your vendor will likely have experience working with other customers — when in doubt ask your vendor to provide you with examples of how other customers are addressing a common issue.</p>
<p id="259b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve built a custom API, here are a few tips to you get started thinking about the issues listed above:</p>
<h4 id="3bc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lend users a hand</h4>
<p id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provide users with enough information to get them started using your API without having the have a human help them. Your IT staff will thank you.</p>
<p id="42a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invest some time in creating user facing materials with examples of how to make calls to your API, and a list of frequently asked questions. The more information you provide up front that makes it easy for users to start using your API the less phone calls and emails you’ll need to respond to.</p>
<p id="11b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, set up a way for users to report issues — a shared email box that is checked regularly is a good way to get started.</p>
<p id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up a way to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.runscope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">monitor the uptime of your API</a> so you’ll know when it’s down. This will allow you to get it back up quickly and also <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communicate to users</a> that you are aware of the problem (again, resulting in fewer phone calls and emails).</p>
<h4 id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Treat your API like a shared resource</h4>
<p id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You should treat an API like a shared resource because that’s exactly what it is — improperly managed, one consumers overuse of this resource can crowd out the legitimate use of others.</p>
<p id="36d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requiring authentication for users is one way to keep track of who is using your API, and issuing API keys is another option. Keep in mind, though, that if users can’t sign up quickly and easily without human intervention, then your phone will start to ring (or your inbox will start to fill up).</p>
<p id="999e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should strongly consider a way to rate limit usage of your API — there are a number of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commercial</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://getkong.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> API tools that can help you do this. You should also give thought to a caching strategy to improve the performance of your API — this includes not only setting up a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proxy cache</a>but also sending the appropriate <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caching headers</a> with your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="1415" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Plan for the future</h4>
<p id="8630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As your API gets used, the people using it will form opinions about what they like and what they don’t like. Give them a way to provide this input to you in a way that you can refer back to. This will help you prioritize changes and enhancements to your API going forward and ensure you are directing your finite resources to the things your users want most.</p>
<p id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll also want to think about things like versioning your API to allow you to gracefully deprecate features and add new ones.</p>
<p id="d14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data APIs are increasingly common in government, and there are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/application-programming-interfaces-apis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> that can help you work through these issues.</p>
<p id="6c6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge of getting operational data from a legacy system and using it to support an internal analytics project, or an external open data effort are increasingly common in municipal government. You’ll face challenges in getting started, but you can take comfort in knowing that lots of other local government IT leaders are traveling this same road. Sharing your experience and asking others to share theirs is an effective way of working through these issues.</p>
<p id="f989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t let the fact that you don’t know everything keep you from doing the things you can do right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4723" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2017/02/14/read-my-book/book-picture/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" data-orig-size="592,398" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="book-picture" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=592" class=" size-full wp-image-4723 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=1000" alt="book-picture" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png 592w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"   /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p id="06dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These tools are more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.livestories.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plentiful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">powerful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://quickcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">flexible</a>, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://dataship.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive</a> than pretty much everything government employees currently have at their disposal. Governments may have exiting relationships with huge tech companies like Microsoft, IBM, Esri and others that have an array of different data tools — it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p id="6033" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the race for better data tools, the general public isn‘t just beating out the public sector, its already won the race and is taking a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/12760040/revisiting-bruce-jenner-historic-olympic-victory-1976-montreal-games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jenner-esque victory lap</a>.</p>
<p id="379c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t a new trend.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4714"></span></p>
<p id="6858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a time when making a map on the internet required specialized skills and proprietary tools. Then along came <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Maps</a>. Now tools like<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mapbox</a>, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://carto.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carto</a> and many others have democratized mapmaking, and — in many ways — given citizen map makers more powerful and easier to use tools than government employees have.</p>
<p id="86ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m emphasizing a point that is pretty obvious but for people that work inside government this has some implications. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">The process of using data to improve the way governments work is inextricably linked to how good governments are at engaging with outside data users.</span></p>
<p id="bcb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public sector employees that want to use data to improve how government operates, enhance the quality of public services or help governments make better decisions will need to employ a new set of skills. It won’t be good enough to simply enhance internal capacity for data analysis or app development (although that’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://kcmo.gov/data/2016/09/12/data-data-data-introducing-kansas-citys-data-academy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pretty important</a> as well).</p>

<p id="f811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is often a relatively new skill set for those in government IT departments and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@mheadd/bridging-the-citistat-gap-ef563328593f#.e7ofan41f" target="_blank">PerformanceStat programs</a> — where government data efforts commonly reside. These departments are typically inward facing — serving the needs of other agencies — and often don’t have long traditions of outside engagement.</p>
<p id="0f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Its time for governments to reimagine their place in the civic technology production chain. More than ever, it is essential that governments assume their role as data stewards, enablers and conveners to bring the power of these new external tools to bear on the problems facing our communities.</p>
<p id="68be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">For governments, outside engagement will turn out to be the most important new tool in the 21st Century data science toolkit.</span></p>

<p>The title of &#8220;Chief Data Officer&#8221; &#8211; once an uncommon one in state and municipal governments &#8211; is becoming less uncommon. And that’s a very good thing for public sector innovation.</p>
<p>As recently as a few years ago, Chief Data Officers were found almost exclusively in big city governments like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. Municipal governments provide services that touch citizens’ lives in more intimate ways than states or the federal government, and big cities have a critical mass of data that is attractive to the growing community of users with powerful tools for mapping and analyzing data. So it’s no surprise that <a href="http://publicsource.org/investigations/wolfs-plan-for-open-data-promising-pennsylvania-has-its-work-cut-out-for-it#.V7MwZZMrJ-V">cities have led the way</a> in creating new, data-focused positions like CDOs, and in releasing open data to the public.</p>
<p>But increasingly, state governments and small to midsized cities are <a href="http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html">appointing Chief Data Officers</a>, and creating new positions that focus almost exclusively on data. For example, earlier this year the City of Syracuse (a city of approximately 145,000 in Central New York) appointed <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/cdo">it’s very first Chief Data Officer</a>. It’s worth noting that this is not a stand alone position as in some other cities. The CDO position in Syracuse was deliberately made part of the city’s internal innovation team (which is funded through the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/">Bloomberg Philanthropies iTeam program</a>) and plays an integral part in the city’s efforts to use data internally to provide services more efficiently.</p>
<p><span id="more-4708"></span></p>
<p>In many ways, the newest cohort of Chief Data Officers being appointed in states and smaller cities highlights an important change in priorities for the CDO position, and for how governments view data as a part of their innovation efforts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opengovdata.org/">open data movement </a>&#8211; coordinated efforts to advocate for the release of data by governments in “open” formats &#8211; is an outgrowth of many earlier good government initiatives. The focus on transparency that was the hallmark of these early open data efforts largely informed the first cohort of Chief Data Officers in big cities like Chicago and Philadelphia. The first order of business for these newly appointed CDOs was the creation of <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/">public-facing web portals</a> that would allow external users to find and access government data. And while transparency remains a top priority of the open data movement, and building and expanding open data portals is still an important part a CDO’s work, the role of Chief Data Officer has started to evolve.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the focus of Chief Data Officers is on the internal use of data for more efficient resource allocation and improved operations. In other words, Chief Data Officers &#8211; once focused almost exclusively on making governments better <em>producers</em> of data &#8211; are increasingly focused on making governments better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>
<p>To some extent, this change in focus is born out of necessity. Governments at every level are under pressure to provide better service with limited resources. Data is a key element to streamlining operations and <a href="http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/municipal-analytics-the-startup-way-873">allocating scarce resources more efficiently</a>, and the tools and expertise for using data are becoming more attainable, even for smaller governments. But the more recent imperative for CDOs to enhance government operations using data and the original focus on government transparency are not mutually exclusive. In fact, these two areas of focus can complement each other, and help drive (and sustain) government innovation into the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic or organizational barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government &#8211; it’s not uncommon for one department to have difficulty obtaining data or information from another. Open data portals make data more discoverable – they obviate the need for special relationships, access or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use (including other government agencies), so fewer resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>When governments release data openly there are a number of very healthy incentives created by external data users. These users expect data to be complete, well documented and regularly updated – when this does not happen governments typically get quick feedback from unhappy users. Data that is regularly updated, well documented and otherwise easier to use has more value for every potential data user – including governments themselves.</p>
<p>So while the role of government Chief Data Officers is evolving, the traditional focus on transparency and sharing data with external users is still critical for governments to achieve their innovation goals.</p>
<p>A commitment to openness makes governments better <em>producers</em> of data, and better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Last August, a </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">study from the Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> identified cities in Upstate New York as places with some of the highest concentrations of poverty for African American and Hispanic populations anywhere in the nation. The problem is particularly acute in the City of Syracuse which holds the  distinction of having the highest level of poverty concentration among African American and Hispanic populations of the one hundred largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This problem isn’t Syracuse’s alone &#8211; the study shows that Rochester and Buffalo also have serious problems with concentrated poverty. But the Salt City is an unfortunate standout in this report. In addition to have the highest concentrations of poverty among African Americans and Hispanics, when looking at concentrated poverty among non-Hispanic whites “&#8230;Detroit, Fresno, and Syracuse are the only metropolitan areas on all three lists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Century Foundation&#8217;s findings echo those of an </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">earlier study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with a similar scope conducted by CNY Fair Housing, Inc. which found that the Syracuse area is “one of the worst scoring cities in the country when looking at equality of opportunity based on race and ethnicity.” Given what we know about how </span><a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods"><span style="font-weight:400;">concentrated poverty affects the life outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for people who live in it, it’s hard to imagine a more serious drag on the growth and well being of our region than deliberately forcing people to live in places where they are surrounded by poverty and given them few options of getting out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But that’s exactly what we do.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4675"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8230;[W]e are witnessing a nationwide return of concentrated poverty that is racial in nature, and &#8230; this expansion and continued existence of high-poverty ghettos and barrios is no accident. These neighborhoods are not the value-free outcome of the impartial workings of the housing market. Rather, in large measure, they are the inevitable and predictable consequences of deliberate policy choices.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8212; Paul Jargowsky, the Architecture of Segregation</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Syracuse&#8217;s issues with poverty and neighborhood decline are not an accident. Like many other cities, Syracuse still shows the scars of <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/HOLC_Maps.htm">redlining</a> and other discriminatory practices that prevented investment in specific neighborhoods deemed at the time to be undesirable. Looking at <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/OldRedlining/HOLC_Maps/Syracuse%201937%20Redline%20Map.pdf">redline maps of Syracuse from the 1930&#8217;s</a> shows a disturbing correlation with neighborhoods that are now struggling with concentrated poverty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our contemporary problems with poverty in Central New York are also not accidental &#8211; they are the result of conscious policy decisions made by government officials in our region and are further amplified by federal and state tax policy. The cumulative impact of these policies has left the Central New York region </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/report_syracuse_and_onondaga_county_suffer_from_hyper-segregation.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">deeply segregated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and with unrivaled levels of concentrated poverty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Improving our community will require us not only to understand how these policy decisions are made and how they contribute to the concentration of poverty, it will require those of us in Central New York not living in areas of high poverty to understand how we are complicit in these decisions. But even beyond this, reversing the concentration of poverty in our region will require political courage and strong leadership from county, state and federal officials.</span></p>
<p><b>The Cost of Complexity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Commission on Local Government Consolidation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (the Consensus Commission) issued a </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/docs/1.26.16_Consensus_PRELIM_RECCS_REPORT.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">preliminary report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> outlining some options for streamlining the administration of local government in Central New York. Under the unifying theme of “we can do better” the Commission listed a host of different areas where local services are duplicative and wasteful. A community wide discussion on the potential benefits of government consolidation has ensued. Though the issue of concentrated poverty is touched on briefly in the Consensus Commission report, one of the primary factors contributing to the problem is buried near the end and not deeply examined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Land use planning (discussed on page 69 of the Consensus Commission report) &#8211; the rules governing what kinds of structures and buildings get built in our community, and where they may be located &#8211; is highly decentralized in Onondaga County, scattered across many local jurisdictions. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">In total, we estimate that more than 550 board members are involved in land use and planning activities across Onondaga County – nearly 200 municipal board members, 195 planning board members, and 169 zoning board members. Each municipality possesses its own zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and other local laws / ordinances related to planning.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Commission on Local Government Modernization, Options Report &amp; Preliminary Committee Recommendations</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even more important, there is a lack of a comprehensive, enforceable land use plan for the entire county to guide this vast collection of local officials. This means that each local governments in Onondaga County has latitude for establishing its own set of rules for land use within its jurisdiction, with no enforceable central coordination at the county or regional level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is a recipe for </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/facts/understanding-exclusionary-zoning-impact-concentrated-poverty/"><span style="font-weight:400;">exclusionary zoning practices</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, which occur when wealthier suburban jurisdictions enact land use restrictions that drive up the cost of housing and crowd out affordable accommodations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Traditionally, exclusionary zoning policies have kept poor, central city residents out of suburbs with minimum lot size requirements, single residence per lot requirements, minimum square footage requirements, and costly building codes. Together, these requirements make it difficult to build multi-family rental units that would allow lower-income residents to live in wealthy suburban developments with access to quality schools and employment.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Elliott Anne Rigsby, Understanding Exclusionary Zoning and Its Impact on Concentrated Poverty</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, low-income residents are priced out of the suburbs by land use decisions that get made by a decentralized collection of small local boards. It is the collective impact of these parochial decisions that has resulted the level of concentrated poverty we see in Syracuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This issue was raised long before the Consensus Commission report, and before the Century Foundation report singled out Syracuse for its unmatched level of concentrated poverty. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">In a 2014, the </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">CNY Fair Housing, Inc. study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> found that</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8230;in many parts of the county, exclusionary zoning policies exist that drive up the cost of developing new housing. This includes large minimum lot size or coverage requirements.  In addition, the County has identified that the lack of uniform procedures among the 34 municipalities within the County Consortium increases the cost of developing housing. This lack of uniformity also reduces transparency in the system, making it more difficult to monitor how the municipalities are working to further fair housing.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; CNY Fair Housing, Analysis of impediments to Fair Housing</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Concentrated poverty in Syracuse is not new &#8211; the problem has festered and deepened over decades (particularly over the last decade and a half according to the Century Foundation report). It is also not accidental &#8211; the cumulative impact of local land use decisions made by hundreds of different local officials in isolation and tax benefits enjoyed disproportionately by residents in wealthier suburban areas all contribute to the severity of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We all carry some of the blame for pushing our community to the brink. </span></p>
<p><b>Subsidizing Poverty</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Century Foundation Report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> provides a clear (and disturbing) picture of concentrated poverty in </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse &#8211; but this only shows one part of the picture. Exclusionary zoning practices and suburban subsidization drives up the cost of home ownership outside of the City of Syracuse &#8211; putting it out of reach for low and moderate income families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using data from </span><a href="http://www.zillow.com/research/data/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Zillow</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, we can get a glimpse of the rest of the picture, and clearly see the disparity in homeownership costs between the poorer sections of the City of Syracuse and more wealth suburban towns and villages.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/793dbc1a-3c94-11e6-9457-0ecfd53eb7d3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">This map shows median home values</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by zip code in Onondaga County as of May 31, 2016. With this view, we get a clearer picture of the impact of exclusionary zoning outside the urban center &#8211; median home values in the suburbs far outpace those in the city. To illustrate this point, consider the <strong>13205</strong> zip code (which encompasses the South side of the City of Syracuse) and the directly adjacent <strong>13078</strong> zip code (which covers the Town of DeWitt). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Median home values in the <strong>13205</strong> zip code in May of this year was $62,500 while those in the <strong>13078</strong> zip code was $225,000 &#8211; a difference of over 350%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s worse &#8211; the impact of exclusionary zoning gets magnified by federal and state tax policies that allow wealthier homeowners to deduct things like </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p936.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and local real estate taxes. These benefits are used disproportionately by higher income taxpayers and provide bigger benefits for homeowners with larger mortgages and bigger tax bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi"><span style="font-weight:400;">zip code data from the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for 2013, we can map the differences in </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">real estate taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> reported on taxpayer returns. The amounts shown in the map below are an average of the deduction amounts reported by zip code, showing the relative benefit of these deduction to individual taxpayers inside and outside the City of Syracuse.</span></p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>With the exception of a small area in Downtown Syracuse, we can see that the deeper blue colors (representing larger benefits) are almost totally in outlying suburban areas &#8211; this subsidy effect is even starker for real estate taxes.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the urban <strong>13205</strong> zip code the average mortgage interest reported on individual returns was about $3,500 and the average real estate taxes reported was about $3,100. In contrast, the <strong>13104</strong> zip code in the Eastern part of the county saw an average mortgage interest of over $7,000 and the average real estate taxes reported over $10,000. These amounts were even higher in the <strong>13152</strong> zip code in the far western part of the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The small area in Downtown Syracuse that saw higher average mortgage interest and real estate taxes reported than the rest of the city likely reflects some recent redevelopment efforts, particularly in the Armory Square area. The overall impact of these tax benefits inside the city is quite low though &#8211; the number of returns in this zip code number only a few hundred, while the number of returns reporting these deductible amounts in the suburbs numbered in the thousands,.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These federal and state tax policies act as a sort of hidden government subsidy for suburban homeowners, deepening the impact of zoning decisions that get made by a maze of local boards and officials. Taken together, the combined impact of these varied policy decisions that get made at different levels of government is to institutionalize a system that encourages higher income homeowners to leave the City of Syracuse and forces lower income homeowners (or would be homeowners) to remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The disorganized nature of these various decisions does give us some wiggle room &#8211; there’s enough space for deniability, to convince ourselves that this is just a “city problem.” But the increasingly concentrated level of poverty we see in Syracuse is not accidental. It is the result of deliberate policy decisions that touch every homeowner in our region &#8211; whether we live in the City of Syracuse or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Everyone&#8217;s hands are a little dirty &#8211; there&#8217;s no smoking gun like with redlining in the 1930&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s but a fog of uneven outcomes and easy excuses hangs over our entire community.</span></p>
<p>We are all complicit in this outcome. And we all have a stake in fixing it.</p>
<p><b>Fixing our Broken Community</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Reversing the level of concentrated poverty in the City of Syracuse is a key to our region’s growth and long-term prosperity. There simply aren&#8217;t any examples of areas in our country with growing economies and populations that have an urban core with the as many problems as ours does. We can&#8217;t hide out in the peace of the suburbs any more and pretend the problems aren&#8217;t ours. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s hard to imagine a realistic plan for economic and community growth that doesn’t address our area’s problems with poverty. And since the factors that created this problem are the result of policy decisions made largely outside of the city, it’s hard to overstate how important it is for real leadership on this issue by county, state and federal officials &#8211; not just for Syracuse, but for other Upstate cities as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fixing this problem will take time, but there are some things we can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">First, let’s hold our county officials accountable when they decide to </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/business-news/index.ssf/2015/09/tax_breaks_approved_for_luxury_apartment_homes_in_lysander.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">subsidize luxury housing in the suburbs</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is just terrible public policy given the current level of poverty concentration in our region’s urban core, and underscores just how rudderless our county’s land use decision making is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Let’s use the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">local dialog happening</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> around the Consensus Commission plan to advocate for centralized land use planning and an enforceable land use plan for Onondaga County. Of all of the many opportunities for consolidation identified in the Consensus Commission plan, this is the one with the biggest potential benefit for our community. If we failed to pursue every other consolidation opportunity but this one, our region could still see enormous benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finally, let’s insist to our state and federal elected officials that any economic development or growth plan they support should include &#8211; as a central component &#8211; addressing concentrated poverty in Upstate cities. This problem is not Syracuse’s alone and it’s hard to imagine an economic  growth plan for the Upstate region being in any way effective if it ignores the fact that we have large portions of our urban populations trapped in poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our current County Executive grew up in the City of Syracuse and the New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader is a lifelong Syracuse resident. The work of the Consensus Commission has been sanctioned and supported by the Governor, and has largely been received well in our community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We seem to have the requisite political clout to begin addressing the problem of concentrated poverty in Syracuse in a real and lasting way. </span></p>
<p>Let’s not miss the chance.</p>

<p>The term “civic tech” gets used a lot, and it often means different things to different people. To me, this has always meant that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly &#8211; all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will ultimately be broad and durable. I’ve never been prone to excessive handwringing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I believe very firmly that the most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all. Real people &#8211; with empathy and a desire to make their community better &#8211; are the most important kind of civic technology. A recently released report on civic technology by Omidyar Network entitled </span><a href="http://enginesofchange.omidyar.com/docs/OmidyarEnginesOfChange.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">Engines of Change</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> underscores this idea, and helps emphasize that the connections between people &#8211; both inside the civic tech community and outside it &#8211; are what&#8217;s most important to its future growth.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4676"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The report presents a blueprint of sorts for how those working in and supporting civic tech can help it grow in a way that deepens its impact and broadens its appeal. It very smartly highlights a set of opportunities for the different groups working in the civic tech ecosystem that each can follow to help civic tech grow. I think that those of us working in this sector should embrace these recommendations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our findings show a critical link between cities and practitioners. Civic tech is not a sector that has been driven forward entirely outside of governmental systems. Rather, it has been built in partnership with key stakeholders inside and outside government&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most impactful of these recommendations for me are those directed toward governments and people working inside cities. The report urges these people to reach out to, engage with, and help grow the civic tech community. Having recently moved from a large city with an active and growing civic tech community, to a smaller city with no tradition of civic hacking and little organized engagement around data or technology, I can say emphatically that there seems to be an acute need here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Connecting with innovators outside government and helping to nurture external communities often falls outside the job description (and the skill set) of most public servants &#8211; even those tasked with running open data or innovation programs. Shoehorning these efforts into a traditional government IT department can </span><a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Philadelphias-IT-Reorganization-Receives-Barbs-and-Praise.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">shackle them to a bureaucratic infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that often has little interest or expertise in outward engagement. Placing them in other parts of the organization may help with external focus but may also erode proximity to the part of the organization where important decisions about data and technology are made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding the right approach to enable government employees to interact with and nurture external civic tech communities can be </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">a tough balance to strike</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This can be particularly true in smaller municipalities with nascent open data and innovation programs, and smaller or more dispersed tech communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over the last few years we’ve seen a growth in the number of resources and tools available to municipal governments and civil servants to </span><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/@centerforgov"><span style="font-weight:400;">open up their data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, enact </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/"><span style="font-weight:400;">policies around innovation and technology</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and to make better use of their data themselves. But there seems to be a noticeable lack of practical resources available to assist government officials with identifying and connecting with people outside of government in the civic tech community. Civic tech can’t flourish unless we educate and support municipal officials in their outreach to these groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s why I’m working on creating </span><a href="https://civic.io/2016/06/21/meeting-in-the-middle/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a new guidebook for local government officials</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, building on my own experience in city government and the expertise of a host of others currently working in cities. This process will be open and collaborative, and the results will be released under a Creative Commons license for any government official to use. I hope this will help those in government embrace the opportunity highlighted in the Omidyar report &#8211; to “engage deeply with local civic tech communities.”</span></p>
<p>Municipal governments and other public sector officials need better tools, broader networks, and more information for building (and sustaining) relationships with outside innovators in civic tech. Building out these resources will help ensure that civic tech becomes what we all hope it can &#8211; and what cities and communities need it to become.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A powerful and enduring force for positive change.</span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Open-Data-APIs-Collecting-and-Consuming-What-Cities-Produce.html">an interesting piece</a> on open data APIs on GovTech that echos <a href="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/">a lot</a> of <a href="https://civic.io/2014/08/11/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-government-apis/">the</a> <a href="https://civic.io/2012/02/23/get-opengovernmentapis/">things</a> I&#8217;ve thought and said about government APIs over the past few years. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>APIs are an increasingly important way that governments make their open data available to outside users. Typically, when we talk about open data APIs (and I am as guilty of this as anyone) its almost always with a focus on either the technical underpinnings and data on one side, or the benefits that citizens will ultimately reap from the data being made available on the other.</p>
<p>There are far too seldom discussions of what lies in the middle of these two ends and how this critical piece ultimately helps make government open data APIs better and citizens better off.</p>
<p><span id="more-4666"></span></p>
<p>As powerful and important as APIs are to making open data available and improving how governments operate, the vast majority of citizens will never consume an API directly from a government data publisher. Most won&#8217;t know or care that data or a service they are using is built on data from a government API. Instead, they will most likely consume a finished product, app or service (or read a new story) that is built on data from an API or some other open data source.</p>
<p>What lies in the middle &#8211; between government APIs and citizens end users &#8211; is an important group of intermediaries (or <a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/717715634226860033">infomediaries</a>). This group is made up of private technology companies, entrepreneurs, volunteer civic hackers, journalists, activists, storytellers and others. It&#8217;s an important group for governments to reach out to, engage with and nurture. Far too seldom in our discussions about how to build great open data APIs do we discuss the strategies and skills needed to do these things.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, and to give people inside government some strategies for engaging with outside data intermediaries, I&#8217;m working on a new guidebook that I hope to make available in the next few months.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This guidebook will be designed to help civil servants find and collaborate with people doing innovative and valuable work outside government, particularly those working with technology and data. It will list specific strategies that can be employed by those working in the bureaucracy to help them leverage the talents of smart, passionate people outside government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to this guidebook, or want to get a peek at an early draft, <a href="mailto:mheadd@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The term “civic technology” gets used a lot, and it may mean different things to different people. I think this highlights the fact that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly — all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will be broad and durable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For me, the term civic technology is inextricably related to the world of </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/11/06/the-collaborative-state/"><span style="font-weight:400;">civic hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. I began my career in government in what I would describe as the “old fashioned way”: graduate school to study public administration followed by work on political campaigns. Having now worked for three different state and local governments in both the legislative and executive branches, I consider civic hacking and civic technology to be the future of how governments will deliver services.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4654"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Distilled to its essence, civic hacking is the existence of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place, and a desire to effect change on that condition. That’s it. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems. Apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a way, civic hacking is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of </span><a href="http://www.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces for interactions with their government. Outside parties have begun developing solutions on top of government-provided or maintained data, often to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, in cities like </span><a href="http://livinglotsnyc.org/#11/40.7300/-73.9900"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the repurposing of vacant properties, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to specific government agencies. These outside efforts are enabled by the </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=property"><span style="font-weight:400;">deliberate release of property information</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by the cities like Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change the way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and, in many ways, an enormous opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This, to me, is the essence of civic technology. Civic tech provides solutions to help governments deliver services to citizens more efficiently. We might think of civic apps as a kind of “last mile” technology — the link between the traditional infrastructure of government technology and the tools people ultimately use to interact with and get information from government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important component of civic technology is that it requires active collaboration between people inside government, including elected officials and government employees, and those outside government, the people in the neighborhoods and communities being served by government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The old way of delivering government services is over. Civic technology — technology we build together — is the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In early 2012, I had the opportunity to present at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Conference in Austin, TX. The focus of my presentation was the</span><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093"><span style="font-weight:400;"> lessons learned from two civic hacking events</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in late 2011 that I had helped organize in Philadelphia and Baltimore.</span></p>
<p>This was an exciting time for me professionally. After leaving government to become a professional software developer and technology evangelist in the early 2000s, I had been drawn back into the world of government a few years prior through the open data movement. By 2011, I was working regularly with budding civic tech communities in two different but geographically close cities. I was able to collaborate with groups of people who cared deeply about the future of their cities and who were committed to making a difference.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was also an exciting time for civic tech—Code for America was launching its </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Brigade</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> network at the 2012 SXSWi conference and while there I had a chance to meet and talk with Jen Pahlka, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, and </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/kevin-curry"><span style="font-weight:400;">Kevin Curry</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (who went on to build out the Code for America Brigade program and scale it nationally). I was so moved by Jen’s vision for civic tech that I ended up leaving my job with a telecommunications startup and joined Code for America myself a few short weeks after SXSWi ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thinking back on this time, it strikes me that the experience of the two cities I got to talk about then can tell us a lot about what it takes to build and grow a civic tech community. I think it’s exciting that there are places where leaders have essentially </span><a href="http://civichall.org/civicist/toward-sustainability-for-local-tech-organizing/"><span style="font-weight:400;">figured out how to nurture and sustain civic tech</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would argue that there are many places where this issue has not yet been resolved, and even some places where civic tech groups once flourished by have have since </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/717364352500817920"><span style="font-weight:400;">gone dormant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Of interest to me personally, there are also a great many places—particularly small and mid-sized cities—where civic tech organizing has not yet begun.</p>
<p><span id="more-4646"></span></p>
<p><b>Then and Now</b></p>
<p>In many ways, Baltimore and Philadelphia were in similar places from a civic tech perspective in 2011.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The City of Baltimore had just launched an official </span><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and was regularly publishing data to it. A series of small(ish) </span><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/civic-hack-day-in-baltimore-tickets-1271496079"><span style="font-weight:400;">hackathons</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> were organized and there seemed to be a </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/baltimore-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">growing dialogue</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> between the local technology community and city government around data and civic technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At the same time, Philadelphia was in </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/philadelphia-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a similar place</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. The city had not yet adopted an open data policy or launched an official open data portal. Philly benefited from being one of the first cities to partner with Code for America and there seemed to be a growing acceptance inside city government for publishing data and generally supporting civic tech. Earlier that year, a local technology company called Azavea built and launched what would become the city’s official open data portal—</span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Open Data Philly</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And yet, if we look at these two cities today they appear to be in very different places with regard to civic tech. Philadelphia has a </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">large and active civic tech community</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with strong connections to city government—city officials are regular participants in civic tech events, and a recent civic hacking event was kicked off from City Hall </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/04/04/demhack-politicians-code-for-philly/"><span style="font-weight:400;">by the Mayor himself</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This community has helped spawn some of the most innovative civic tech solutions in the country, like </span><a href="https://www.councilmatic.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Councilmatic</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—which has since gone on to be adopted in other cities like Chicago and New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore, however, doesn’t have a clearly identifiable civic tech community—though there have been </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/"><span style="font-weight:400;">efforts to create one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. There are no regular meetups of people interested in working on civic issues, no regular events to bring the community together and grow it, no regular interactions between city officials and outside civic technologists. This is not because the city lacks passionate, talented people interested in working on civic tech. Far from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore has not been completely silent on the civic tech front since 2011. There have been a few events—like </span><a href="https://cityparksblog.org/tag/baltimore/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack the Parks</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—that started to build up the relationship between city government and the technology community. These events were largely due to the efforts of people like Andrew Hazlett and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Sharon_Paley"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sharon Paley</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (now with the </span><a href="http://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University). But the organization behind these events—the Greater Baltimore Technology Council—is now </span><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2014/02/24/gbtc-goes-on-hiatus-plans-to.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">defunct</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and no similar organization in Baltimore has moved to fill the role once played by the GBTC in leading civic tech organizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Digital Harbor Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, under the leadership by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewcoy"><span style="font-weight:400;">Andrew Coy</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—now at the White House, and one of the co-organizers of the civic hacking event in Baltimore I talked about at SXSW in 2012—has developed some pioneering youth technology initiatives in Baltimore. But these efforts seem to operate in a different space from the one we typically expect a civic tech community to occupy. In fact, they seem almost ideally positioned to act as a feeder program for a larger civic tech effort—bringing in young people with passion for their city and arming them with technical skills they can use to make a difference.</span></p>
<p>But that doesn’t seem to be happening largely because of the absence in Baltimore of an organized civic tech community that we typically see in other cities. There isn’t an organized community to feed these youngsters into that’s focused on using technology for the public good in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Both cities have an abundance of factors that I think are critical in helping develop a healthy civic technology community. They both face some pretty significant challenges, have developing startup communities and are full of talented, passionate people that want to work to make their city better. They also both have governments that at least publish some open data and have a formal policy around releasing data.</p>
<p>But beyond simply publishing data, there is at least one factor that is different—the level of involvement by city government in Philadelphia and Baltimore in their respective civic tech communities.</p>
<p><b>The Role of the City</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Writing about his work in supporting </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chi Hack Night</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—the wildly successful and influential civic hacking meetup in the City of Chicago—</span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/the-civicwhitaker-anthology-53351581"><span style="font-weight:400;">Christopher Whitaker</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> notes the important role played by city government in building the Chicago ecosystem:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of why we’re able to have as much impact as we do is because we have built a civic innovation ecosystem&#8230;each of these different parts compliments the other. The City of Chicago provides the data that powers the engine. The Chi Hack Night provides a place for talent and collaboration. The Smart Chicago Collaborative provides institutional support.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having city officials engaged and present at civic technology events is a key ingredient to their success, growth and longevity. As a former city official that was present at a lot of civic technology events in Philly my opinion on this issue is not unbiased. But this is a trend that is easy to spot in cities that have active civic tech communities like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/minervatweet/status/512024965294850048"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/messages/boards/thread/48563907"><span style="font-weight:400;">San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/05/19/predicting-food-inspection-outcomes-using-open-data.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/04/hackathon-in-boston-7-hubhacks-data-visualization-finalists/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/people/timwis"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>And if I had to point to one single factor that has stymied the growth of an organized civic tech community in Baltimore—a place with all of the other ingredients necessary for one to flourish—I would point to a lack of active involvement and support from city government.</p>
<p>And if this is right, then I think there are some important lessons here for supporters of civic technology.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There are lots of places where the issue of organizing and sustaining civic technology has not yet been resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Clearly there are places like Chicago where great strides have been made due to years of investment and institutional support. But there are many other places that have not yet started down the road of civic tech. And as is generally the case with support for open data, these places </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">tend to be small and mid-sized cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that lack institutions like Smart Chicago to support nascent civic tech efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The lessons from Philly and Baltimore also suggest that the progress we have seen in larger cities may be more fragile than we think it is. If direct and enthusiastic support from city government is essential to successfully organizing civic tech efforts, then what happens when that support goes away?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">New York City, under Mayor Bill deBlasio, and Philadelphia, under new Mayor Jim Kenney, suggest that a commitment from city government to open data and engagement with the civic tech community can survive the transition from one administration to the next. But I think it makes sense to consider what happens to civic tech communities when this commitment doesn’t survive that kind of transition, or evaporates for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In Madison, Wisconsin, an enthusiastic and growing civic tech community has </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">grown largely stagnant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> because of a lack of support from city government and hesitancy to release useful data. Derek Eder—one of the organizer of Chi Hack Night in Chicago—in talking about the struggles in the civic tech community in Madison, has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think the government, especially the city, deserves a lot of credit for helping start the community [in Chicago].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s right, and we shouldn’t forget this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Far from being a resolved issue, civic tech organizing in many places is still in its infancy. Rather than declaring victory, our work should now be focused on institutionalizing things that support civic tech so we can help ensure it survives going forward.</span></p>
