										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4723" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2017/02/14/read-my-book/book-picture/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" data-orig-size="592,398" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="book-picture" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=592" class=" size-full wp-image-4723 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=1000" alt="book-picture" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png 592w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"   /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p>The term “civic tech” gets used a lot, and it often means different things to different people. To me, this has always meant that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly &#8211; all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will ultimately be broad and durable. I’ve never been prone to excessive handwringing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I believe very firmly that the most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all. Real people &#8211; with empathy and a desire to make their community better &#8211; are the most important kind of civic technology. A recently released report on civic technology by Omidyar Network entitled </span><a href="http://enginesofchange.omidyar.com/docs/OmidyarEnginesOfChange.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">Engines of Change</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> underscores this idea, and helps emphasize that the connections between people &#8211; both inside the civic tech community and outside it &#8211; are what&#8217;s most important to its future growth.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4676"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The report presents a blueprint of sorts for how those working in and supporting civic tech can help it grow in a way that deepens its impact and broadens its appeal. It very smartly highlights a set of opportunities for the different groups working in the civic tech ecosystem that each can follow to help civic tech grow. I think that those of us working in this sector should embrace these recommendations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our findings show a critical link between cities and practitioners. Civic tech is not a sector that has been driven forward entirely outside of governmental systems. Rather, it has been built in partnership with key stakeholders inside and outside government&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most impactful of these recommendations for me are those directed toward governments and people working inside cities. The report urges these people to reach out to, engage with, and help grow the civic tech community. Having recently moved from a large city with an active and growing civic tech community, to a smaller city with no tradition of civic hacking and little organized engagement around data or technology, I can say emphatically that there seems to be an acute need here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Connecting with innovators outside government and helping to nurture external communities often falls outside the job description (and the skill set) of most public servants &#8211; even those tasked with running open data or innovation programs. Shoehorning these efforts into a traditional government IT department can </span><a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Philadelphias-IT-Reorganization-Receives-Barbs-and-Praise.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">shackle them to a bureaucratic infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that often has little interest or expertise in outward engagement. Placing them in other parts of the organization may help with external focus but may also erode proximity to the part of the organization where important decisions about data and technology are made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding the right approach to enable government employees to interact with and nurture external civic tech communities can be </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">a tough balance to strike</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This can be particularly true in smaller municipalities with nascent open data and innovation programs, and smaller or more dispersed tech communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over the last few years we’ve seen a growth in the number of resources and tools available to municipal governments and civil servants to </span><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/@centerforgov"><span style="font-weight:400;">open up their data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, enact </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/"><span style="font-weight:400;">policies around innovation and technology</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and to make better use of their data themselves. But there seems to be a noticeable lack of practical resources available to assist government officials with identifying and connecting with people outside of government in the civic tech community. Civic tech can’t flourish unless we educate and support municipal officials in their outreach to these groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s why I’m working on creating </span><a href="https://civic.io/2016/06/21/meeting-in-the-middle/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a new guidebook for local government officials</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, building on my own experience in city government and the expertise of a host of others currently working in cities. This process will be open and collaborative, and the results will be released under a Creative Commons license for any government official to use. I hope this will help those in government embrace the opportunity highlighted in the Omidyar report &#8211; to “engage deeply with local civic tech communities.”</span></p>
<p>Municipal governments and other public sector officials need better tools, broader networks, and more information for building (and sustaining) relationships with outside innovators in civic tech. Building out these resources will help ensure that civic tech becomes what we all hope it can &#8211; and what cities and communities need it to become.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A powerful and enduring force for positive change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The term “civic technology” gets used a lot, and it may mean different things to different people. I think this highlights the fact that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly — all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will be broad and durable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For me, the term civic technology is inextricably related to the world of </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/11/06/the-collaborative-state/"><span style="font-weight:400;">civic hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. I began my career in government in what I would describe as the “old fashioned way”: graduate school to study public administration followed by work on political campaigns. Having now worked for three different state and local governments in both the legislative and executive branches, I consider civic hacking and civic technology to be the future of how governments will deliver services.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4654"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Distilled to its essence, civic hacking is the existence of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place, and a desire to effect change on that condition. That’s it. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems. Apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a way, civic hacking is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of </span><a href="http://www.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces for interactions with their government. Outside parties have begun developing solutions on top of government-provided or maintained data, often to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, in cities like </span><a href="http://livinglotsnyc.org/#11/40.7300/-73.9900"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the repurposing of vacant properties, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to specific government agencies. These outside efforts are enabled by the </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=property"><span style="font-weight:400;">deliberate release of property information</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by the cities like Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change the way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and, in many ways, an enormous opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This, to me, is the essence of civic technology. Civic tech provides solutions to help governments deliver services to citizens more efficiently. We might think of civic apps as a kind of “last mile” technology — the link between the traditional infrastructure of government technology and the tools people ultimately use to interact with and get information from government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important component of civic technology is that it requires active collaboration between people inside government, including elected officials and government employees, and those outside government, the people in the neighborhoods and communities being served by government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The old way of delivering government services is over. Civic technology — technology we build together — is the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In early 2012, I had the opportunity to present at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Conference in Austin, TX. The focus of my presentation was the</span><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093"><span style="font-weight:400;"> lessons learned from two civic hacking events</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in late 2011 that I had helped organize in Philadelphia and Baltimore.</span></p>
<p>This was an exciting time for me professionally. After leaving government to become a professional software developer and technology evangelist in the early 2000s, I had been drawn back into the world of government a few years prior through the open data movement. By 2011, I was working regularly with budding civic tech communities in two different but geographically close cities. I was able to collaborate with groups of people who cared deeply about the future of their cities and who were committed to making a difference.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was also an exciting time for civic tech—Code for America was launching its </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Brigade</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> network at the 2012 SXSWi conference and while there I had a chance to meet and talk with Jen Pahlka, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, and </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/kevin-curry"><span style="font-weight:400;">Kevin Curry</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (who went on to build out the Code for America Brigade program and scale it nationally). I was so moved by Jen’s vision for civic tech that I ended up leaving my job with a telecommunications startup and joined Code for America myself a few short weeks after SXSWi ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thinking back on this time, it strikes me that the experience of the two cities I got to talk about then can tell us a lot about what it takes to build and grow a civic tech community. I think it’s exciting that there are places where leaders have essentially </span><a href="http://civichall.org/civicist/toward-sustainability-for-local-tech-organizing/"><span style="font-weight:400;">figured out how to nurture and sustain civic tech</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would argue that there are many places where this issue has not yet been resolved, and even some places where civic tech groups once flourished by have have since </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/717364352500817920"><span style="font-weight:400;">gone dormant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Of interest to me personally, there are also a great many places—particularly small and mid-sized cities—where civic tech organizing has not yet begun.</p>
<p><span id="more-4646"></span></p>
<p><b>Then and Now</b></p>
<p>In many ways, Baltimore and Philadelphia were in similar places from a civic tech perspective in 2011.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The City of Baltimore had just launched an official </span><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and was regularly publishing data to it. A series of small(ish) </span><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/civic-hack-day-in-baltimore-tickets-1271496079"><span style="font-weight:400;">hackathons</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> were organized and there seemed to be a </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/baltimore-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">growing dialogue</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> between the local technology community and city government around data and civic technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At the same time, Philadelphia was in </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/philadelphia-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a similar place</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. The city had not yet adopted an open data policy or launched an official open data portal. Philly benefited from being one of the first cities to partner with Code for America and there seemed to be a growing acceptance inside city government for publishing data and generally supporting civic tech. Earlier that year, a local technology company called Azavea built and launched what would become the city’s official open data portal—</span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Open Data Philly</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And yet, if we look at these two cities today they appear to be in very different places with regard to civic tech. Philadelphia has a </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">large and active civic tech community</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with strong connections to city government—city officials are regular participants in civic tech events, and a recent civic hacking event was kicked off from City Hall </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/04/04/demhack-politicians-code-for-philly/"><span style="font-weight:400;">by the Mayor himself</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This community has helped spawn some of the most innovative civic tech solutions in the country, like </span><a href="https://www.councilmatic.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Councilmatic</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—which has since gone on to be adopted in other cities like Chicago and New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore, however, doesn’t have a clearly identifiable civic tech community—though there have been </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/"><span style="font-weight:400;">efforts to create one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. There are no regular meetups of people interested in working on civic issues, no regular events to bring the community together and grow it, no regular interactions between city officials and outside civic technologists. This is not because the city lacks passionate, talented people interested in working on civic tech. Far from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore has not been completely silent on the civic tech front since 2011. There have been a few events—like </span><a href="https://cityparksblog.org/tag/baltimore/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack the Parks</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—that started to build up the relationship between city government and the technology community. These events were largely due to the efforts of people like Andrew Hazlett and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Sharon_Paley"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sharon Paley</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (now with the </span><a href="http://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University). But the organization behind these events—the Greater Baltimore Technology Council—is now </span><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2014/02/24/gbtc-goes-on-hiatus-plans-to.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">defunct</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and no similar organization in Baltimore has moved to fill the role once played by the GBTC in leading civic tech organizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Digital Harbor Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, under the leadership by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewcoy"><span style="font-weight:400;">Andrew Coy</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—now at the White House, and one of the co-organizers of the civic hacking event in Baltimore I talked about at SXSW in 2012—has developed some pioneering youth technology initiatives in Baltimore. But these efforts seem to operate in a different space from the one we typically expect a civic tech community to occupy. In fact, they seem almost ideally positioned to act as a feeder program for a larger civic tech effort—bringing in young people with passion for their city and arming them with technical skills they can use to make a difference.</span></p>
<p>But that doesn’t seem to be happening largely because of the absence in Baltimore of an organized civic tech community that we typically see in other cities. There isn’t an organized community to feed these youngsters into that’s focused on using technology for the public good in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Both cities have an abundance of factors that I think are critical in helping develop a healthy civic technology community. They both face some pretty significant challenges, have developing startup communities and are full of talented, passionate people that want to work to make their city better. They also both have governments that at least publish some open data and have a formal policy around releasing data.</p>
<p>But beyond simply publishing data, there is at least one factor that is different—the level of involvement by city government in Philadelphia and Baltimore in their respective civic tech communities.</p>
<p><b>The Role of the City</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Writing about his work in supporting </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chi Hack Night</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—the wildly successful and influential civic hacking meetup in the City of Chicago—</span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/the-civicwhitaker-anthology-53351581"><span style="font-weight:400;">Christopher Whitaker</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> notes the important role played by city government in building the Chicago ecosystem:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of why we’re able to have as much impact as we do is because we have built a civic innovation ecosystem&#8230;each of these different parts compliments the other. The City of Chicago provides the data that powers the engine. The Chi Hack Night provides a place for talent and collaboration. The Smart Chicago Collaborative provides institutional support.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having city officials engaged and present at civic technology events is a key ingredient to their success, growth and longevity. As a former city official that was present at a lot of civic technology events in Philly my opinion on this issue is not unbiased. But this is a trend that is easy to spot in cities that have active civic tech communities like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/minervatweet/status/512024965294850048"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/messages/boards/thread/48563907"><span style="font-weight:400;">San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/05/19/predicting-food-inspection-outcomes-using-open-data.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/04/hackathon-in-boston-7-hubhacks-data-visualization-finalists/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/people/timwis"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>And if I had to point to one single factor that has stymied the growth of an organized civic tech community in Baltimore—a place with all of the other ingredients necessary for one to flourish—I would point to a lack of active involvement and support from city government.</p>
<p>And if this is right, then I think there are some important lessons here for supporters of civic technology.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There are lots of places where the issue of organizing and sustaining civic technology has not yet been resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Clearly there are places like Chicago where great strides have been made due to years of investment and institutional support. But there are many other places that have not yet started down the road of civic tech. And as is generally the case with support for open data, these places </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">tend to be small and mid-sized cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that lack institutions like Smart Chicago to support nascent civic tech efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The lessons from Philly and Baltimore also suggest that the progress we have seen in larger cities may be more fragile than we think it is. If direct and enthusiastic support from city government is essential to successfully organizing civic tech efforts, then what happens when that support goes away?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">New York City, under Mayor Bill deBlasio, and Philadelphia, under new Mayor Jim Kenney, suggest that a commitment from city government to open data and engagement with the civic tech community can survive the transition from one administration to the next. But I think it makes sense to consider what happens to civic tech communities when this commitment doesn’t survive that kind of transition, or evaporates for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In Madison, Wisconsin, an enthusiastic and growing civic tech community has </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">grown largely stagnant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> because of a lack of support from city government and hesitancy to release useful data. Derek Eder—one of the organizer of Chi Hack Night in Chicago—in talking about the struggles in the civic tech community in Madison, has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think the government, especially the city, deserves a lot of credit for helping start the community [in Chicago].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s right, and we shouldn’t forget this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Far from being a resolved issue, civic tech organizing in many places is still in its infancy. Rather than declaring victory, our work should now be focused on institutionalizing things that support civic tech so we can help ensure it survives going forward.</span></p>

<p>Unshoveled sidewalks during the winter months are a persistent problem for cities in the snow belt.</p>
<p>For places with significant snowfall, unshoveled sidewalks pose a challenge to public safety and mobility for those that rely on walking (or public transit), and present an especially acute problem for those that have <a href="http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2016/02/wheelchair-users-disabled-weather-snow-storm/459855/">physical impairments</a>. Uncleared snowfall on other kinds of public infrastructure &#8211; like fire hydrants &#8211; also poses dangers for city residents and public safety workers.</p>
<p>This is a sometimes daunting issue for cities that government officials, community groups and civic technologists perennially struggle with. Over the past several years, a number of civic technology projects have been initiated with the goal of mitigating the problem of uncleared sidewalks and <a href="http://www.wkbw.com/news/five-minutes-of-shoveling-could-save-a-life">other public infrastructure</a> in cities. Few have been widely adopted, and &#8211; if we&#8217;re being honest &#8211; the impact of these efforts on reducing the problems associated with uncleared snowfall has been minimal.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of the problem seems relatively straightforward, and would appear to be a pretty good fit for a properly designed civic app. But despite several different efforts, there is not yet a widely adopted civic tech solution that most people would agree has had a meaningful impact on the problem.</p>
<p>In many ways, unshoveled sidewalks help highlight both the potential and the limitations of civic technology.  For those that care about civic tech, this issue is worth understanding more fully.</p>
<p><span id="more-4209"></span></p>
<p><strong>Civic Tech for Snow Removal</strong></p>
<p>One of the first civic apps developed by Code for America was <a href="http://www.adoptahydrant.org/">Adopt-a-Hydrant</a> for the City of Boston. The app created an easy way to volunteer to clear the area around a fire hydrant after a significant snowfall.</p>
<p>This app has since been deployed for other cities, and converted to support volunteers that want to help take care of other kinds of civic infrastructure like <a href="http://sirens.honolulu.gov/">tsunami sirens</a>, <a href="http://adoptadrainoakland.com/">water inlets</a> and sidewalks. In Chicago, the base Adopta-a-Hydrant app was repurposed and set up to allow volunteers to clear sidewalks after snow storms.</p>
<p>And though uncleared sidewalks are a persistent problem in the Windy City, the app <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">saw little adoption</a> and is now dormant.</p>
<p>While the group responsible for deploying Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">offered some criticisms of the app itself</a> to help explain its low adoption rate, it should be noted that when it was originally developed this app was pretty groundbreaking. And the basic idea of an app to allow citizens to volunteer to help maintain and clear civic infrastructure &#8211; which Adopta pioneered &#8211; is one of the more potent and durable ideas in the world of civic tech.</p>
<p>But an easy solution to help mitigate the perennial problem of blocked sidewalks and covered hydrants continues to elude those of us in the world of civic tech. And it&#8217;s not for a lack of trying. In addition to <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/adopt-a-sidewalk">Chicago&#8217;s Adopt-a-Sidewalk</a>, there are a number of other civic tech projects that have attempted to address this problem.</p>
<p>311 apps may let city dwellers report snow removal issues, and 211 services may let property owners in need of assistance find help if they need it. The civic tech company SeeClickFix operates a service call <a href="https://snowcrew.org/">Snow Crew</a> and at least two recent civic hacking events (one of which &#8211; in full disclosure &#8211; I am a judge for) have seen sidewalk snow removal <a href="https://github.com/codeforboston/Snope-Mobile-App">apps</a> <a href="http://devpost.com/software/shoveler">developed</a>. There are even efforts to use <a href="https://twitter.com/unshoveled">traditional social media</a> as a way to call attention to the problem of uncleared walkways.</p>
<p>As a community, those in civic tech appear to have acknowledged that this is an issue worth solving. And if nothing else, web and mobile technologies have been shown to be pretty damn good at <a href="https://www.casseroleclub.com/">connecting those in need with volunteers that have the time or resources to help</a>. This should be a fixable problem, right?</p>
<p>And yet, every time the snow falls in non-trivial amounts in cities across the snow belt, the problems return.</p>
<p><strong>The Curious Case of Snow Removal</strong></p>
<p>In some ways, the problem of snow removal is unique in the context of allowing volunteers to help maintain civic infrastructure. As noted by the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/improving-adopt-a-sidewalk/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> &#8211; which oversaw the deployment of Adopt-a-Sidewalk in Chicago, the seasonality of the problem can make adoption difficult:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the application is useless when there is no snow on the ground. Adopt-a-sidewalk is irrelevant in the summertime, and, for most of the winter spent between snow storms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further muddying the water for potential volunteers, and unlike other kinds of public infrastructure, <a href="http://www.dsmic.org/documentstore/Plans%20and%20Studies%20(Corridor)/UMD-CSSAreaTransportationStudy/Snow%20Removal%20Ordinance%20Comparison.pdf">many cities in the snowbelt</a> require property owners to clear the sidewalks adjacent to their property or potentially incur fines. More than for other types of Adopta app uses, there is the potential for allowing people to volunteer to take care of infrastructure that they are already legally responsible for clearing.</p>
<p>Some cities in the snowbelt &#8211; but not all &#8211; may also provide sidewalk clearance services by <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936460">assessing a special fee</a> on property owners, by <a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/snow/shovel/index.htm">clearing problem sidewalks and billing those not in compliance</a> with local ordinances, or by <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/snow_corps.html">helping marshal volunteers</a> to help those in need.</p>
<p>But even in places where government is proactive about snow removal, the problems still exist. For example, the City of Rochester, New York has a service for clearing sidewalks of snow, but it doesn&#8217;t kick in until at least 4 inches have fallen. In addition, scheduling considerations can potential delay sidewalk clearing in different parts of the city depending on the nature of a particular storm.</p>
<p>Even a city like this one, that provides a service for clearing sidewalks and has decades of experience with contemporary snow removal practices <a href="http://reconnectrochester.org/blog/2015/03/finding-a-solution-for-sidewalk-clearing-in-rochester/">still regularly sees residents complain</a> of being negatively impacted by uncleared walkways and other public infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is a problem that neither the civic tech community nor governments seem to be able to develop a comprehensive solution for on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Toward Better Civic Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>For some types of civic tech solutions, the absence of a strong government partner isn&#8217;t a major issue. In fact, there are a number for which the very existence of an app can be tied to governments not being involved in a specific activity, or shirking their responsibility.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.detroitwaterproject.org/">Detroit Water Project</a> was started to assist residents who had their water service discontinued by the City of Detroit because of an inability to make payments. It was actions taken by the city itself that created the problem being addressed by this civic app.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">Grounded in Philly</a> was started to help promote alternate uses for vacant property in Philadelphia &#8211; a persistent problem for which the city has been long been <a href="http://planphilly.com/series/abandoned-city">slow to respond</a>.</p>
<p>Both are examples of civic projects that address an acute need not currently being met by city government. In some ways, this approach has advantages &#8211; working with governments to get them to adopt, endorse or even to advertise civic apps can be a challenge.</p>
<p>I once worked on a project at a hackathon in Philadelphia to develop <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2011/08/24/philly-snap-hackathon/">an app for locating farmers markets and other outlets where fresh food could be purchased with SNAP benefits</a>. The official list of these locations is maintained by the City of Philadelphia, and the app was embraced by local non-profits working to make food available to SNAP recipients. But when asked if the city would help advertise the availability of the app, at no cost to the city itself, officials refused.</p>
<p>This kind of story is all too common in the world of civic tech.</p>
<p>To make a dent in the problem of unshoveled sidewalks and other public infrastructure, city officials and civic technologists are going to need to figure out ways to more effectively collaborate on solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>To be successful, civic apps will need to be accompanied by strong municipal policies (and enforcement of those policies) for unshoveled sidewalks and critical infrastructure. Civic apps can make up a part of the solution to this persistent problem, but probably not all of it. This may require working not only with executive branch agencies, but also with <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/syracuse_council_again_considers_50_fines_for_people_who_dont_shovel_sidewalks.html">city council members</a>.</p>
<p>Civic apps should probably be targeted to compliment existing municipal efforts where they exist &#8211; for example, in places like <a href="http://www.cityofrochester.gov/article.aspx?id=8589936460">Rochester</a> and <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/snow_corps.html">Chicago</a>, where some sidewalk snow removal assistance is already provided. Civic apps may also be valuable in helping raise awareness and ensure better compliance with existing municipal ordinances for clearing snow from sidewalks and fire hydrants.</p>
<p>Civic technologists can also help jurisdictions in the snow belt make better decisions on how to allocate limited snow removal resources. There is an abundance of data that can be used to better direct sidewalk snow clearing efforts like 311 data, locational data for schools, nursing homes, day care centers, bus stops and even data on vehicle registrations that can help identify elderly or handicapped individuals who may need more targeted assistance.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to not only help address a problem that is common in many cities in this country (and that disproportionately falls on those with fewer resources, a dependency on public transit and that are elderly or disabled), but also to expand our knowledge on how civic tech projects can become more collaborative with government partners.</p>
<p>If we can identify an approach that works, there is the real potential to gain valuable knowledge that can assist all kinds of civic tech projects.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t figured out yet how civic tech can mitigate the problem of uncleared sidewalks. But when we do, the potential payoff could be bigger than <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaytamboli/4371305208/in/photolist-7Eh5Kb-br4aSk-7CmW1G-95hx4W-vmrmN-7B82SZ-Eh7Z-dTBo1d-9iKX5T-4dWvPk-9Exz7k-99KsZj-7mc3mQ-68ExgX-5X54UE-4oMJkq-7Cq4yw-4qRCAi-7D8yHS-9f93AC-5LrsET-9EAuaw-k64skn-9dzc4H-qVvrap-93mL5Z-7CLaLN-k48P8h-7Gn3PS-dCFRPW-bcq3yB-5KPaRS-k65oGM-7CiG8i-5NXfBU-7BF3Tp-7GwHyr-Tcx7f-jz8NRz-ktHCdF-5FwYB1-7HvdAu-4sMxG1-7EdetM-9w6LQb-5RudTB-D2aF6A-4bpvp3-7C7nxT-dZ4mNr">a snow pile in February</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The article evaluates the outcomes of some of the early government app challenges like the District of Columbia&#8217;s </span><a href="https://isl.co/work/apps-for-democracy-contest/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Apps for Democracy Contest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and offers observations on several new approaches being employed by governments to derive “greater civic benefit” from open data programs.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4174"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I was a participant in several early civic app challenges &#8211; including the Apps for Democracy Contest, in which I won a </span><a href="http://voiceingov.org/2008/10/30/dc-crime-finder/"><span style="font-weight:400;">silver medal in one of the challenge categories</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8211; and I’ve been involved with open data and civic hacking since early 2008. I’ve helped organize and sponsor lots of civic hacking events in multiple cities, so I’ve feel like I’ve had a chance to see how these events have evolved over the last several years from different perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This article by Lee, Almirall and Wareham does a decent job of highlighting some of the shortcomings of the early government app contests &#8211; many of which have been discussed by other observers. However, I think it misses some things that both governments and open data advocates should keep in mind if we’re going to realize the full promise of open data.</span></p>
<p><b>Civic Hacking: Beyond the App Contest</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">First, though the article mentions Code for America, it does so only in the context of the organization’s </span><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/"><span style="font-weight:400;">fellowship program</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Completely overlooked in the article is the </span><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Brigade</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> &#8211; groups of local civic hackers that have spread across the United States and to other countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Dozens of these groups have formed to bring together hackers and others to connect, collaborate and work on projects. Meetings take place monthly and sometimes weekly. Some groups boast membership in the hundreds and have </span><a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/index.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">been holding regular meetings for several years</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. I think it’s fair to say that the majority of civic hacking currently happening in the U.S. (and likely in other counties as well) is taking place outside of government-sponsored app contests and is being done through the efforts of groups like CfA Brigades and other local groups.</span></p>
<p>The members of these groups are not paid for their work &#8211; it’s almost entirely a volunteer effort, with members donating their time and skills to work on projects that they care about. This raises an important point about these community-driven civic hacking efforts that may distinguish them from the efforts fostered through government app contests that promise more finite timelines and cash prizes.</p>
<p><b>The Gift Relationship</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a now classic 1970 book entitled “</span><a href="http://thenewpress.com/books/gift-relationship"><span style="font-weight:400;">The Gift Relationship: From Human Blood to Social Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">,” social researcher Richard Titmuss contrasted the blood donation programs in the United States and the United Kingdom in the hopes of shining a light on the power of altruism and volunteer efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In his study, Titmuss observed that the quality of blood donated in the U.K. (where donors were not compensated) exceeded the quality of blood donated in the U.S. (where donors were paid for their donations). Donors in the U.K. were most likely motivated to give blood out of a sense of public duty, while those in the U.S. were motivated (at least in part) out of out a sense of personal gain. Titmuss reckoned that the U.S. system motivated less than optimal donors to give blood less regularly, which impacted the quality of blood and caused the supply of blood to be much less predictable.</span></p>
<p>The takeaway from Titmuss’ work? Volunteer efforts where participants are motivated out of a sense of public duty and altruism can produce better outcomes than efforts where people are paid (or rewarded financially) for their efforts. Needless to say, the debate around these findings has raged for many years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But if we look at the world of civic hacking &#8211; the state it’s in currently and the road we’ve traveled to get here &#8211; we can see how Titmuss’ idea about the power of altruism might apply. Many questions remain about the viability of government sponsored app contests, and some governments (e.g., <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-16/business/chi-apps-for-metro-chicago-winner-named-20111216_1_android-app-top-prize-grand-prize">Chicago</a>) seem to have abandoned them altogether. In contrast, the world of volunteer civic hacking is healthy, vibrant and growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This post is not meant to suggest that government sponsored app contests can’t be run successfully or don’t provide benefits to governments. </span><a href="http://bigapps.nyc/p/"><span style="font-weight:400;">They can and do</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. It&#8217;s also not meant to suggest that successful civic technology projects can&#8217;t generate revenue or work toward becoming profitable. <a href="http://www.govtech.com/100/">A growing number are</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But I think that the ideas of Richard Titmuss are relevant in contemporary discussions of civic hacking. They underscore the power of altruism and help us understand that civic hacking is &#8211; in some sense &#8211; the digital age manifestation of </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/11/06/the-collaborative-state/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a long tradition of volunteerism</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that has benefited governments for many years and enabled them to provide higher quality services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When we look at the future of open data, it seems clear that the most significant benefits for governments might be realized with the help of groups of volunteers working to make their communities better.</span></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a gift no government should overlook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Designing simple systems is one of the great challenges of Government 2.0. It means the end of grand, feature-filled programs, and their replacement by minimal services extensible by others.</p>
<p>&#8212; Tim O’Reilly, <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html">Open Government</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The original idea of Government as a Platform is now almost a decade old. In the world of technology, that’s a long time.</p>
<p>In that time, people working inside and outside of government to implement this idea have learned a lot about what works well, and what does not. In addition, we’ve seen some significant changes in the world of technology over the past decade or so, and the way the we develop solutions (both <a href="http://www.buildwith.org/">in the world of civic tech</a>, and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">outside of it</a>) have changed fairly dramatically.</p>
<p>The power of the original idea for Government as a Platform continues to echo in the world of civic tech and open data. I have no doubt that it will for a long time to come.</p>
<p>But in 2015 what does Government as a Platform actually look like, and what should it look like going forward into the future? What are its component parts? How does it manifest in terms of actual infrastructure, both inside and outside government?</p>
<p>And, most importantly, who controls this infrastructure and has a say in how it is shaped and used.</p>
<p><span id="more-4006"></span></p>
<p><b>The Architecture of Government as a Platform</b></p>
<p>The idea of Government as a Platform &#8211; originally built on the idea of open government data &#8211; has become almost synonymous with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).</p>
<p>APIs are <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">an important part</a> of how modern software is developed, and have been for some time. Building APIs, and the accompanying tools to use them, are at the core of what most governments aspire to put in place to support the development of civic apps. A number of different <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/">federal agencies</a> do this, as do large cities like <a href="https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/">New York</a>, <a href="http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/developer-resources/">Chicago</a>, <a href="http://phlapi.com/">Philadelphia</a> and others.</p>
<p>For many governments, the centerpiece of their efforts to support civic apps is an open data portal. Open data portals provide a central location for governments to publish data so that it may be more easily obtained by third parties wishing to use it. In addition, these data portals almost always provide some sort of API access to data &#8211; so by publishing data to an open data portal, governments are creating APIs for developers to start using that data to build civic apps.</p>
<p>An overview of how Government as a Platform typically manifests can be seen in the graphic below.</p>
<p><a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4008" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/gaap-1/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png" data-orig-size="1788,1257" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="gaap-1" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Government as a Platform Today&lt;/p&gt;
" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=1000" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4008" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=1000&#038;h=703" alt="gaap-1" width="1000" height="703" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=1000&amp;h=703 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=768&amp;h=540 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png?w=1024&amp;h=720 1024w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gaap-1.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>In this scenario, governments make APIs available to third parties for building civic apps. Governments may build <a href="http://phlapi.com/">custom APIs</a> for these third parties, or they may leverage the APIs that are <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/datastore.html#the-datastore-api">baked into their open data portals</a>. Alternatively, governments may choose to release the raw data that is used by third parties and civic tech actors to build their own APIs to power civic apps.</p>
<p>In general, this scenario sees governments acting as the stewards of data and APIs and empowering third parties to use these resources to build services which can be used by citizens to get information from government or to conduct transactions.</p>
<p>Third party civic app developers are consumers of data from government &#8211; either through a government managed API or by taking raw data from a government open data portal and creating their own APIs. The roles of data publisher and data consumer in this scenario are clearly defined.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why the role of data publisher is a better one for governments – governments have historically not made good bets on technology. They’re <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">not set up to do it properly</a>, and as a result it&#8217;s not uncommon to see governments invest in technology that quickly becomes out of date and difficult to manage. This problem is particularly acute in relation to web-based services and applications – which outside civic technologists are very good at building – because the landscape for developing these kinds of applications changes far too rapidly for governments to realistically stay current.</p>
<p>There are also benefits for third party civic app developers in this scenario. As more and more governments open their data and deploy open data portals or custom APIs, civic app developers can build solutions that benefit not just one jurisdiction, but many others that may face a similar issue or need.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence to suggest that this approach is working. More and more governments are launching data portals and <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/">releasing open data</a>, and more and more groups of <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">civic technology advocates</a> are coalescing around these platforms to build new civic technology solutions.</p>
<p>But we have enough experience with this model now to critically evaluate how well it works, and to determine if it will help realize the full potential of the civic technology movement.</p>
<p><b>What We’ve Learned So Far</b></p>
<p>I can think of three key takeaways from what can be described as the “first phase” of Government as a Platform. There may be more, but I think these are among the most important.</p>
<p><i>The line between data producers &amp; data consumers is fuzzy</i></p>
<p>The open data movement has its roots in the government transparency movement that came before it and gave it life. As a result, the traditional idea of &#8220;open government data&#8221; views governments as producers of data and outside actors (journalists, researchers, developers) as consumers of data.</p>
<p>But early on in the open data movement, it became apparent that <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/02/internal-benefits-of-external-data/">governments themselves stand to benefit greatly</a> from the process of releasing data in open formats. Opening data for external consumers means that anyone &#8211; inside or outside of government &#8211; can access it. The process of making open data available for external users makes it <a href="https://civic.io/2015/01/17/altitude-training-for-data/">more discoverable and more valuable</a> for internal data consumers.</p>
<p>Governments – big ones especially – are notoriously complex and stove-piped. Open data can help mitigate the impact of this organizational complexity, particularly if it is structured for easy use by outside developers as an API. As a result, governments themselves are becoming major consumers of the data they release on open data portals and through custom APIs.</p>
<p><i>Building APIs can be as challenging as building apps</i></p>
<p>For all the potential that open data and APIs may hold for governments the process of planning, developing, and maintaining big, expansive APIs <a href="https://civic.io/2012/03/21/to-api-or-not-to-api/">can be a challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The task of building and managing custom APIs often falls &#8211; for a variety of reasons &#8211; to a government’s central IT agency. Making one group within a government’s technology hierarchy responsible for custom API development and management can sometimes create issues. Proper stewardship of APIs often requires <a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/13/some-tips-on-api-stewardship/">specialized technical knowledge</a> and may also require specialized domain knowledge to understand the data that is being exposed through the API.</p>
<p>In addition, along with the new role of managing a production-grade API for external development, governments face the (still relatively new) challenge of <a href="https://civic.io/2013/09/17/the-lesson-of-pennapps/">building and managing developer communities around them</a>. Concentrating responsibility for all of this in one particular group within the broader government IT community can create a bottleneck.</p>
<p>And while this reality can make the out of the box APIs built into open data platforms more attractive, this option is essentially a “one size fits all” answer for the needs of data users. Most open data portals are not built to incentivize data standardization because the end goal is simply publishing &#8211; making the data available. This often leaves the hard work of cleaning and standardising government data to external users, or layers a <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries.html">SQL-like interface</a> on top of disparate data sets which can add complexity to civic apps and make them more brittle.</p>
<p><i>Building reusable civic apps is hard. </i></p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://www.citygram.org/">notable</a> <a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">examples</a> of civic apps that have been deployed in multiple cities. This is encouraging to see, and validates some of the original vision for Government as a Platform, but often this is the exception to the rule. Reuse &#8211; it turns out &#8211; is really hard.</p>
<p>There is significant <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/07/17/introducing-zoningcheck/">technical and administrative heterogeneity</a> between governments and this has made efforts to share open source applications like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120505002240/http://civiccommons.org/">CivicCommons</a> and the earlier <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Open_Code_Collaborative">Government Open Code Collaborative</a> much less successful than most proponents would have hoped.</p>
<p>It is becoming more broadly acknowledged in the world of technology that the once sacrosanct mantra of &#8220;build for reuse&#8221; might not actually make sense in every scenario. Building for reuse is <a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7#.60vib6z9f">difficult and expensive</a>. Some argue that developers should <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use">engineer for replacement</a> instead of reuse.</p>
<p>So knowing what we know now about the concept of Government as a Platform, how should we design the architecture of open data and civic technology for the future?</p>
<p>I am increasingly thinking that the answer &#8211; at least in part &#8211; is to think smaller.</p>
<p><b>What are Microservices?</b></p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.</p>
<p>&#8212; Martin Fowler, <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">Microservices</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Microservices is a term used to describe a specific architectural style for building software applications. In essence, a microservices approach envisions the building of an application as the process of assembling a number of different small, independently running services &#8211; each distinct from each other.</p>
<p>I find this approach to be particularly interesting in light of some other recent observations on how we build software &#8211; specifically, the “no stack” approach:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Some characteristics [of no stack apps] is that they use other platforms and APIs (or protocols, in the case of SMS) to cobble together a service and in doing so rely almost wholly on those platforms and APIs for every function of the business other than the one they can be the best at.</p>
<p>&#8212; Andy Weissman, <a href="http://blog.aweissman.com/2015/05/no-stack-startups.html">The No Stack Startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The term microservices is particularly “buzzy” at the moment, and some people claim is just the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25501098/difference-between-microservices-architecture-and-soa">latest articulation of a much older concept</a> in the world of technology. Nevertheless, I think the idea of microservices holds enormous potential for the way that we build civic applications and addresses some of the key issues that have been encountered in the first phase of Government as a Platform.</p>
<p><b>Government as a Platform in a Microservices World</b></p>
<p>So what does the infrastructure of civic tech look like if we apply the principles of the microservice architectural style? Here is one way I believe it can look.</p>

<p>The centerpiece of this approach is not a government open data portal, but rather a centralized hub for routing requests and controlling access to different microservices &#8211; essentially, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a>. Governments would manage this new civic tech infrastructure by managing access to different resources through this proxy.</p>
<p>Services would be compact and focused on doing one thing well. Because of this, the development and management of different services could be farmed out across the government IT footprint (and even out to the civic tech community). The central IT organization would no longer need to have concentrated expertise in both API management and domain knowledge in the data being exposed. Agencies outside the central IT agency would become full partners in building and maintaining the civic tech infrastructure.</p>
<p>Services can be created and consumed by both governments and third party civic app developers. Governments may deploy services for things like address verification and <a href="https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc">geocoding</a>, while civic tech companies might deploy services to <a href="http://zoning.io/">check zoning designations</a> and to do things as simple as <a href="https://parserator.datamade.us/usaddress">parsing an address</a>.</p>
<p>An area that seems particularly well suited for a microservice approach in the local government space is property data. Data on properties can span multiple agencies within a government and across multiple governments (e.g., city, county and state government). In Philadelphia, almost half a dozen different agencies maintain data on properties &#8211; the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/opa/Pages/default.aspx">Assessors Office</a>, the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/cityplanning/Pages/default.aspx">Planning Commission</a>, The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/revenue/Pages/default.aspx">Revenue Department</a>, The <a href="http://www.phila.gov/water/Pages/default.aspx">Water Department</a> and the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/li/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections</a>. In addition, there are non-City entities like the <a href="https://www.philadelphiaredevelopmentauthority.org/">Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority</a> and utility companies like the <a href="http://www.pgworks.com/">Philadelphia Gas Works</a>, Comcast and Verizon that all have information on properties in the city.</p>
<p>Each entity&#8217;s view of a property is through the lens of the service or oversight they are charged with. One property can have multiple representations in the systems of various different government offices and agencies.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where the Department of Licenses &amp; Inspections wants to issue a building permit or rental license to a property owner &#8211; a service for property tax balance could help them ensure that permits aren&#8217;t issued to owners with outstanding property tax bills.</p>
<p>Suppose the Revenue Department wants to set up a payment plan for a property owner with an outstanding tax liability &#8211; a service for gas utility payment would let them check if the owner is in arrears on other payments.</p>
<p>Consider a non-profit that wants to encourage urban gardening &#8211; a healthy collection of services around property data would make it easy to check for properties that are optimally zoned, contain enough permeable square footage to support a garden, determine if there are liens agains the property that might prevent such a use, and even to determine who the owner is so they can conduct outreach.</p>
<p>Microservices can make all of these activities simpler and more efficient.</p>
<blockquote><p>Government should only do what only government can do. If we’ve found a way of doing something that works, we should make it reusable and shareable instead of reinventing the wheel every time. This means building platforms and registers others can build upon, providing resources (like APIs) that others can use, and linking to the work of others. We should concentrate on the irreducible core.</p>
<p>&#8212; Government Digital Service, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">Design Principles</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In instances where governments don’t build services themselves, or seek greater control than indirectly leveraging the efforts of civic technologists, they could use <a href="http://openprocure.us/">existing small dollar purchasing options</a> to contract for the development of new microservices.</p>
<p>Citizen-facing solutions would be built by government agencies as well as third party civic app developers. Civic apps would become simpler and more replaceable. With a reduced emphasis on engineering for reuse, developers could focus more directly on the needs of the people using civic apps. Interfaces can be tailored more efficiently and more cheaply based on our understanding of user needs or to respond to new policy imperatives.</p>
<p>This approach would better leverage both the internal (inside government) and external (civic tech) communities to deploy new services and make data more useful. A reduced emphasis on a homogenous technology foundation could make it easier to adopt new technologies as they emerge and reduce the risk of large scale system failures.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is what the future of civic tech looks like, but I do think its time we started talking about it.</p>
<p>Almost a decade on, a lot of work has been done to implement the idea of Government as a Platform, and we&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way. It&#8217;s time to put the hard won knowledge we&#8217;ve accumulated to date to work building the next phase of Government as a Platform.</p>
<p>Note &#8211; Eric Jackson, co founder of Democracy Apps, has written a <a href="http://democracyapps.us/some-thoughts-on-mark-headds-thinking-small-post/">thoughtful response to this post</a> with some great ideas for implementing the concept discussed here. Worth checking out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who uses civic technology, and why should we care?</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/files/2015/10/demographics-report.pdf">new study from mySociety</a> &#8211; a non-profit based in the UK that focuses on civic tech &#8211; helps us answer these questions and provides some invaluable information for the civic technology community, and for governments.</p>
<p>mySociety surveyed civic technology users in four countries to understand the characteristics of civic tech users and their attitudes toward the solutions they are using. This is an important study that will no doubt be discussed in great detail in the civic tech community, but I see two key takeaways that bear some immediate discussion.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4003" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2015/10/29/who-uses-civic-tech/1725308_40026bdbfd_b/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg" data-orig-size="1018,354" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="1725308_40026bdbfd_b" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=1000" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4003" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=1000&#038;h=349" alt="1725308_40026bdbfd_b" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=349 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=150&amp;h=52 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=300&amp;h=104 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg?w=768&amp;h=267 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/1725308_40026bdbfd_b.jpg 1018w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /></p>
<p><span id="more-3999"></span></p>
<p>First, the users of civic technology solutions believe they have value:</p>
<blockquote><p>Individuals are citing civic technology as the cause of an increase in confidence in approaching public officials. This form of empowerment has numerous potential positive outcomes for individuals, for politics and communities. If civic technology is helping to increase citizens’ confidence in engaging with civic life, even if that is only in a small way such as reporting issues, questioning politicians or officials, or asking for information, this is likely to be contributing to a greater plurality and quality of discourse in the public sphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is encouraging, and it validates the reason that many people become involved in civic tech projects. However, this perceived legitimacy of civic tech solutions comes with some risk:</p>
<blockquote><p>If sites are believed to be having an effect on government behaviour, and are in fact, not doing so, the risk of disillusionment in such platforms is very high once this fact is established. Far from improving government accountability, there is a strong possibility that this eventuality would ‘poison the well’ of civic technology in certain territories in the short to medium term and cause a long term reduction in confidence in similar innovations.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests very strongly that those of us working in civic tech need to carefully manage expectations and be transparent about what we think the actual impact of our ideas and solutions can be.  We should be very judicious in our use of words like &#8220;transformational,&#8221; &#8220;disruptive,&#8221; and &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; when talking about our work.</p>
<p>Maybe more importantly were the finding on the demographics of civic tech users, particularly in the U.S.:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those individuals that are already effective and able to engage with governance mechanisms are facilitated by civic technology to engage more efficiently. Those individuals without such efficacy remain outside the system, either choosing not to engage digitally, or unaware that such engagement is even possible or desirable. This effect is stark in the data from the US, where 74% of users are over the age of 45, and 74% are educated to degree level or higher. The UK performs poorly in male-bias, with 65% male users, of whom 72% are over the age of 45, and 57% hold a first degree or higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the users of civic tech solutions tend to be people who typically are already empowered to engage with government and those that are disempowered are less likely to use civic tech solutions. If the promise of civic technology is that it can help empower traditionally marginalized communities in obtaining services and information from government, and engaging with their elected officials, then we have work to do.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there may be another way to look at this finding&#8230;</p>
<p>If we consider that civic technology solutions may provide an additional option for citizens that want to interact with government (e.g., using an app like <a href="http://www.publicstuff.com/residents">PublicStuff</a> vs. calling 311 on your phone), then it is possible that the use of these apps may be accompanied by a decrease in use of existing engagement channels. People that can use civic technology to engage may elect do so  (because they have the technology required to do so, or the awareness of this option), leaving resources allocated for existing channels to be focused on other users that may need more intensive engagement.</p>
<p>Most services request apps that let citizens report issues only cover a subset of possible report types &#8211; usually the most common types. If a citizen wishes to report an atypical issue type &#8211; something that happens less frequently or is inherently more complex &#8211; they will likely need to call 311 and report the issue to an agent. For governments that operate 311 centers, call center agents are by far the most expensive and valuable resource they have. If civic technology solutions like PublicStuff can help those citizens most able to &#8220;self serve&#8221; report their issue on their own through an app, then it may lead to a more efficient allocation of scare resources (call center agents) to the kinds of reports where they are most needed.</p>
<p>If the use of civic tech solutions provides a new channel for some users to engage with government, does this reduce pressure on other, more traditional channels for engagement? If so, how do we reallocate the resources used to support those existing channels to ensure they are focused on marginalized and underserved communities? And if we do, can we ensure that the quality of the experience between civic technology solutions and more traditional government engagement channels is comparable?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the answers, or even if these are the right questions. Clearly more research is needed in this area.</p>
<p>Having said that, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/files/2015/10/demographics-report.pdf">this new study from mySociety</a> offers invaluable information to those of us in the civic tech community that we can use to enhance our impact.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><br />
&#8220;Systems are broken because they exist to sustain themselves, and the people who run the system rely on the system to stay the same. Why should they change it? It works well for them.&#8221;<br />
</strong><br />
&#8212; <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/">Chris Guillebeau</a></p>
<p>My friends at Technical.ly Philly ran <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2015/09/09/tim-wisniewski-property-record-data/">an interesting piece</a> yesterday about the long road to the release of an important data set on property valuations and ownership in the City of Philadelphia. It&#8217;s definitely worth a read.</p>
<p>The story is compelling for many reasons. It details the interactions of a small group of people (myself included) moving <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/08/26/aaron-ogle-civic-technology-director/">into</a> and <a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/">out of</a> government and employing different strategies to win the release of property data &#8211; a resource much sought after in the journalism and civic hacking communities in Philadelphia. Throughout the story an interesting dichotomy emerges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck the system&#8221; or &#8220;work the system&#8221; &#8211; which approach works better?</p>
<p><span id="more-3925"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>So, then, is the lesson here that city chief data officers need to play the long game? Wait till the naysayers leave city government? Choose their battles in the meantime? And &#8230; does that mean that some data might be locked up indefinitely?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting question. I certainly have my own opinions but I don&#8217;t pretend to know the correct answer. In many ways, I think we&#8217;re all still finding this out.</p>
<p>However, if we&#8217;re going to take time to evaluate which approach works better then I think it makes sense to consider what the ultimate objective of a municipal open data program is (or should be).</p>
<p>If the objective of an open data program is to produce more open data then I think there is an argument to be made that working within the system has some advantages. As open data becomes more familiar to people working in government, and as more people move into government service from the civic technology community, attitudes about it are bound to become more favorable. Open data and civic hacking are now topics of regular discussion in public administration programs across the country. The relentless march of attrition will no doubt help ensure a more favorable view of open data over time.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think the end goal of open data programs should be simply to produce more open data. Data releases are incidental to much larger, more fundamental changes that need to happen in the way government operates and is organized.</p>
<p>We live in a time when data and technology play an increasingly important role in how the business of government is conducted &#8211; particularly for local governments that must balance their budgets and face eroding tax bases. And yet, government is <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">spectacularly ill equipped</a> to acquire and manage modern technology assets. The end game on open data has always been about something larger than simply filling up an open data catalog &#8211; open data is a pathway to creating <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/02/internal-benefits-of-external-data/">a new way of operating in government</a>.</p>
<p>These changes will be hugely disruptive to the way that governments operate today, and have for a long time. They will require a new way of thinking about how we organize government, and how changes to the structure of government are made. They will require government leaders and government employees to <a href="https://civic.io/2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/">change the way they think</a> about what they do and how they do it.</p>
<p>In the end, I think the question of whether to &#8220;buck the system&#8221; or to &#8220;work the system&#8221; may not be the right one.</p>
<p>The better question is what approach can we use to change the current system, to help governments become more efficient and more effective at doing their job.</p>
