<h1 id="6b0a">Hey there!</h1>



<p id="1f02">Are you thinking of joining the federal government to build better digital services for those that need them? Are you new to government service?</p>



<p id="0226">Awesome! This post is for you.</p>



<span id="more-4808"></span>



<p id="bfe8">You may not have an especially positive view of government technology. You may have heard about all the bureaucracy. Lots of waterfall. Lots of big design and requirements gathering up front. Big, complex, infrequent, risky deployments. Government has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/highrisk/overview">all of these</a>!</p>



<p id="6940">You may think that government&nbsp;IT shops need to learn more about agile, and DevOps, iterative delivery, and generally more about the way that product teams deliver stuff in the private sector. And you’d be right — we do need more of that.</p>



<p id="6843">But what you may not know, and what may take you a while to figure out, is that a lot of the things that make delivering digital services in government more difficult exist for a reason. There is a constituency for the madness we see in government IT — someone whose objectives and goals are served by the labyrinth processes and rules we must navigate in order to ship something.</p>



<h1 id="9f9c">The Year of COBOL</h1>



<p id="72e9">If you were reading or watching the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/">news about state Unemployment Insurance systems melting down</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, you probably heard the word COBOL.</p>



<p id="f521"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>&nbsp;is a programming language that was created decades ago to run on mainframe computer systems and is still in use today, most especially in government. You may even encounter it after you start your journey in public service. In some ways, COBOL and its continued use by states and the federal government became a convenient scapegoat for the problems that public benefit systems experienced this year. But the truth was deeper than that.</p>



<p id="8ed2">One of my favorite write ups on COBOL this year is from the technology historian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iit.edu/directory/people/mar-hicks">Mar Hicks</a>, who&nbsp;<a href="https://logicmag.io/care/built-to-last/">details how COBOL was developed and became widely used</a>&nbsp;in both government and the private sector. A point in this essay that resonated strongly with me is that one of the reasons that COBOL is so often disparaged in the world of “modern technology” is because of the characteristics of the language that were meant to make it easy to use:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>But despite this, there’s a cottage industry devoted to making fun of COBOL precisely for its strengths. COBOL’s qualities of being relatively self-documenting, having a short onboarding period (though a long path to becoming an expert), and having been originally designed by committee for big, unglamorous, infrastructural business systems all count against it.</p></blockquote>



<p id="df8d">So, the features of the COBOL language specifically designed as virtues have become the reason it is so often scorned.</p>



<p id="44ab">There is a parallel here that we can draw with government — the features of government designed specifically to be virtuous (and which, as a result, can introduce complexity and bureaucracy) are the reason it is so often scored.</p>



<h1 id="6e99">Complex by Design</h1>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To overcome bureaucracy, we need to separate those of its aspects that are problematic from those that are not, and focus our efforts on the former.</p><p>— Mark Schwartz,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Delicate_Art_of_Bureaucracy/qUXcDwAAQBAJ">Author</a>&nbsp;and former CTO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</a></p></blockquote>



<p id="c319">Governments don’t use waterfall because they like it (spoiler: they don’t). They don’t do massive up front requirements gathering, sometimes taking years before a single user is talked to or line of code is written, because it results in better outcomes (spoiler: it doesn’t).</p>



<p id="87fd">They do these things because the budgetary, regulatory and oversight environment in which government IT operates&nbsp;<em>favors</em>&nbsp;these methods. It rewards projects that use them with approvals, and funding, and ATOs.</p>



<p id="e69b">And the fact that people in government might use these methods isn’t as irrational as it might first seem.</p>



<p id="8eec">Governments are complex because they are big and have lots of responsibilities, but they are also complex on purpose. The complexity is baked in as a way to guard against things like corruption and the concentration of power. Oversight and auditing powers are vested in different parts of the government, and they all have a legitimate and important role in how services get delivered.</p>



<p id="8bf3">Our government was&nbsp;<a href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/founding-documents/primary-source-documents/the-federalist-papers/federalist-papers-no-51/">designed to make it harder to do things quickly</a>&nbsp;and effectively. That notion is as American as apple pie. And while this isn’t always the reason that government technology projects fail, it is a common reason why a project team might adopt suboptimal practices.</p>



<p id="a708">Someone else in the government enterprise has a need or objective that is served by the requirements imposed on technology projects. And those requirements incentivize the things we preach against in pursuit of successful outcomes. It’s not an information deficit on good practices that leads project teams to do things the wrong way, but rather&nbsp;<a href="https://mheadd.medium.com/filling-up-the-civic-tech-toolbox-a976161a84be">a rational response</a>&nbsp;to bureaucratic pressures they are facing.</p>



<p id="1f7a">“Reforming” the way we do government technology, or scaling good practices across agencies will require us to understand the nature of these incentives, why they exist, whose purposes they serve, and how they push project teams to adopt bad practices.</p>



<p id="442d">We need more people in government who understand the practices that help ensure successful delivery of government digital services. We also need more people in government who understand the constraints and incentives facing agencies who want to adopt them.</p>



<p id="1e7a">We need you.</p>

<h3>How Poor Technology Choices Can Magnify the Challenges Faced by Those Seeing Government Services</h3>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For every 10 people who said they successfully filed for unemployment benefits during the previous four weeks three to four additional people tried to apply but could not get through the system to make a claim. Two additional people did not try to apply because it was too difficult to do so. When we extrapolate our survey findings to the full five weeks of UI claims since March 15, <strong>we estimate that an additional 8.9–13.9 million people could have filed for benefits had the process been easier</strong>. [Emphasis added]</p>
<p><cite><em>Unemployment filing failures: New survey confirms that millions of jobless were unable to file an unemployment insurance claim. </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.epi.org/blog/unemployment-filing-failures-new-survey-confirms-that-millions-of-jobless-were-unable-to-file-an-unemployment-insurance-claim/" target="_blank">Economic Policy Institute</a></cite></p>
<p></p></blockquote>


<p>The impact on jobs and our economy from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the attempts by our government to provide relief for those impacted through the CARES Act has brought into sharp focus the issue of <em>administrative burden</em>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.13134" target="_blank">Administrative burden</a> can be succinctly defined as “an individual’s experience of a policy’s implementation as onerous.”</p>



<span id="more-4789"></span>



<p>In the book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Administrative_Burden.html?id=CLB4DwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Administrative Burden: Policy Making by Other Means</em></a>, Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan define administrative burden as the aggregate <em>learning</em> cost, <em>compliance</em> cost, and <em>psychological</em> cost of meeting the requirements to access a government service or benefit. As we watch almost in real time as state benefit systems fail again and again from the increased demand for benefits spurred by the crisis, we see that the cost of this burden is steep indeed.</p>



<h3>Turning Burdens up to&nbsp;11</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/f31a8-1_kr4e7lhyo3potymberj4a.gif" alt="" /></figure></div>



<p>A key takeaway for me from the writing of Herd and Moynihan is that efforts to impact administrative burden can have a reinforcing effect. Efforts running in parallel to ease burdens can sometimes amplify each other:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>…program simplification around the brand of BadgerCare [the name for the State of Wisconsin’s Medicaid program] lessoned burdens not only by reducing the number of forms an applicant had to complete, but also by facilitating marketing and outreach efforts around a single easily identifiable non stigmatizing program. <strong>Any approach to reducing burdens should therefore consider how different techniques can work together.</strong> [Emphasis added]</p></blockquote>



<p>It seems obvious now that this amplifying effect can work the other way as well, and that many of the issues we are seeing with state benefit systems are a result of this form of “burden reinforcement.”</p>



<p>Poor technology choices — many of them easily avoidable and relatively easy to correct — are reinforcing the existing administrative burden faced by applicants. The impact of these technology choices is often inadvertent, and distinct from technology implementations that may be made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/upshot/unemployment-state-restrictions-pandemic.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">specifically</a> to enhance burdens, and reduce access to programs or benefits.</p>



<p>What are some examples? This is far from an exhaustive list, but some that easily come to mind are:</p>



<ul><li>Dynamically generation of web pages for information about the ongoing crisis, rather than static pages, or the use of optimized caching.</li><li>Leveraging browser-specific functionality, or failing to optimize for mobile, or low-bandwidth situations.</li><li>Sites not optimized for disability access.</li><li>Sites not optimized to scale out to meet demand in times of heavy use.</li><li>Poorly designed or confusing IVR trees</li><li>Poorly advertised contact, office location, or mailing address information.</li><li>Poorly designed, confusing or opaque content on program details or requirements.</li></ul>



<p>None of these observations are new or original, and there are <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">some amazing resources available</a> that provide insights into the technology choices that support public benefit systems across all fifty states that are worth exploring in depth.</p>



<p>What seems overlooked in the literature about administrative burden that the current crisis helps underscore is that these poor technology choices can be “situationally burdensome,” amplifying burden more acutely when circumstances change. The environment in which burdens play out, and have an impact on those who apply for services, is dynamic. As circumstances change, design choices that may not have presented a significant burden to users in the past, can present new and unforeseen challenges.</p>



<p>For example, state unemployment benefits might be conditioned on an applicant certifying during the application process that they would return to work if offered a job. In most circumstances, including such a requirement in the application process might seem like a modest burden to impose (and one easily rationalized by policy makers). However, during a global pandemic, where returning to a shared workplace might present real health risks, it creates a dilemma for applicants. This policy choice carries a situational burden and dramatically impacts the learning and compliance costs of applying for benefits during a health crisis.</p>



<p>Similarly, a state that neglects to design a benefit system to scale adequately to meet demand runs the risk of imposing a situational burden. During times when demand for services are steady or relatively modest, these choices may not impose an undue burden on applicants. But when demand for a service spikes, applicants are often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/nyregion/coronavirus-pandemic-unemployment-assistance-ny-delays.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">confronted with significant burdens</a> in accessing services.</p>



<h3>De-amplifying Burdens</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/b93cd-1ozupnzhhywv1sfzh1ad0zw.gif" alt="" /></figure></div>



<p>But why should we care so much about these kinds of technology choices, and the reinforcing impact they can have on the burden eligible recipients face in accessing services?</p>



<p>These choices serve to amplify the existing burden associated with accessing information or services from government, specifically learning and compliance burdens, by making a service more difficult to apply for using a technology device (a web browser or telephone). This amplified burden falls disproportionately on people with restricted access to technology, or who use less modern technology. So, correcting these issues will disproportionately benefit these populations as well.</p>



<p>These fixes <em>should</em> be non-controversial, and in some cases relatively easy. Correcting these mistakes won’t impact eligibility for a service, or requirements for receiving benefits — just the level of effort required to find out about a service, and comply with requirements.</p>



<p>Correcting these issues can also be a way to help underscore the importance of sound technology choices as a way to buffer against administrative burden. Helping policy makers and others in government understand why these choices amplify burden can act as a pathway to understanding the connection between properly implemented technology and sound policy execution.</p>



<p>One final reason why helping governments fix these common mistakes, that is often less talked about, is accountability. In her book <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Automating_Inequality.html?id=_TdCDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><em>Automating Inequity</em></a><em>,</em> Virginia Eubanks provides a vivid and detailed description into the design of public benefit systems specifically engineered to reduce take-up by <em>eligible</em> recipients. She uses the example of the State of Indiana’s welfare automation effort to illustrate:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Indiana automated eligibility system enhanced the state’s already well-developed diversion apparatus…[b]y narrowing the gate for public benefits and raising the penalties for noncompliance, it achieved stunning welfare role reductions.</p></blockquote>



<p>Poor technology choices that reinforce burdens and make it more difficult for applicants to receive benefits can create confusion about <em>why</em> people don’t apply for or receive benefits. Is it because systems are designed to be punitive, and are engineered to remove eligible people from the benefit rolls more quickly? Or is it because the burden they present (or are perceived to present) to eligible applicants, through long wait times and confusing requirements, seems insurmountable and not worth the effort?</p>



<p>Our ability to hold our officials accountable for the policy choices they make is obscured when they can blame a lack of take-up for benefits on a website issue or technical glitch. Helping to ensure that sound technology choices are made is the best way to ensure that those eligible for public services receive them as quickly and as easily as possible.</p>



<p>It’s also the best way to ensure that our leaders are held accountable for the policy choices they make.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Famed management consultant Peter Drucker is often credited with the phrase “culture eats process (or strategy) for breakfast.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can’t change organizations by implementing new processes alone, so the thinking goes, you have to foster a new culture in order to drive real change. To understand the degree to which this idea is accepted as management philosophy gospel, we have but to count the number of times it is repeated at conferences, in meetings, or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/_jfeldman/status/1222660625794584576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a> by various thought leaders.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But when we think about changing the way public sector organizations work, particularly in how they acquire and manage new technology, this idea gets flipped. In the world of government technology, process eats culture for breakfast.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">One of the great truisms that underlies much of the work being done by digital service teams in governments around the world, and in civic tech communities, is that governments are not very good at adopting or managing new technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of general disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly — technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">People working in and around government digital transformation often take the position that the disfunction they see in public sector technology adoption is the result of a lack of knowledge or awareness on how to do something “the right way.” As a result, a great deal of energy and effort is expended telling governments how to do things differently when it comes to technology adoption. We often seek to develop a new culture in government organizations — one that values the input of users, embraces smaller projects and more speedy deployment, and highlights the value of cross functional teams.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But what if we proceeded from the assumption that there are people in government who generally know that they need to change the way they do things, but are unable to do so. Framed this way, the challenge for those of us working in government digital transformation becomes less about telling people <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what </em>to do, and more about understanding the barriers keeping them from doing things differently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The challenges facing governments as it relates to technology adoption are quite specific — there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. More importantly, each of these processes that hinder efficient technology adoption work <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">as designed</em>. They are not broken. They exist for a reason.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these processes are, and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically. If we don’t these process will end up eating the new culture we hope to bring to government organizations, and the problems we hope to solve will go on.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It’s no secret that reduced project sizes and more rapid delivery to users improves project success rates, but why is it still so common to see large technology projects with long delivery timelines in government?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Let’s think about the processes that impact how a government technology project gets funded, approved, and implemented. these includes things like the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/federal-budget-process.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget process</a>, intergovernmental <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding and governance processes</a>, and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://atos.open-control.org/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accreditation process</a> for software applications.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Federal and state budget processes begin many months before a single dollar ever gets spent. As much as 18 months before a budget is even enacted, the executive branch will transmit instructions to agencies for preparing the future budget request. This will include a complex set of documents that will capture the amount of funding that agencies will request , as well as a detailed justification for why they need it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies will need these detailed justifications as the embark on a months-long set of hearings where their requests are questioned and scrutinized over and over again, first by the executive budget office and then later by legislative committees. Digital service teams often engage with agency partners after a budget has already been enacted, and the agency is ready to spend the money that has been approved. It’s not uncommon for these teams to find the agency’s plans for spending approved funds to be overly detailed and prescriptive, suffering from all of the symptoms of the Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) approach.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The success of a digital service teams’ efforts in working with an agency partner like this typically depends on whether they can instill the culture of “smallness,” by adopting approaches like modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile. Unwinding these plans for overly large technology projects, which fail more often than smaller ones, is not always successful. What’s often missed is that the budget process that makes funding for these projects available doesn’t just allow large projects to happen, it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">incentivizes</em> them. It makes larger projects more likely than smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies that can describe in detail to executive branch officials and legislators exactly how they will spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 18–24 months in advance are the ones that get their projects funded. BRUF is a virtue in the process in which budgets get formulated and adopted. It’s a process tailor made to encourage a waterfall approach to projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are similar effects from other processes central to how technology projects get funded and approved. The process that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governs how states receive funding for systems to administer federal programs</a> (e.g., Medicaid) have similar waterfall- inducing features. When these processes require states to develop large, detailed plans up front for funding approval, and impose burdensome gated reviews checkpoints during project execution, it makes larger (and more complex, and riskier) projects <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> likely.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is also true of the processes whereby software applications are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2017/volume-2/navigating-the-us-federal-government-agency-ato-process-for-it-security-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accredited and granted approval to operate</a> — a key milestone in many government technology projects. In some federal agencies, this process can take many months, or even years. The process usually requires many steps, lots of manual work and is paperwork-intensive.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because agencies face these burdensome processes at key approval points in a technology project’s lifecycle, it’s not hard to understand why larger projects are more common. From the perspective of the agencies that must comply with gated reviews and ATOs, it’s rational to decide on a project approach that minimizes exposure to these processes. If iterative delivery of smaller project components requires an agency to navigate these labor and time intensive processes more frequently, it helps us understand more clearly why larger projects are more common.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">In the early days of government digital service teams, the goal was to bring a new culture to government — one that approached risk differently, and placed the needs of users at the center of the work. A decade or so into this work it, seems more obvious than ever that simply bringing a new culture to government technology projects won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Simply telling agencies what they need to do misses the influence of existing processes — all working exactly as designed — on technology project outcomes. The need to reform these fundamental processes underscores that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://peknet.com/2020/02/15/digital-service-is-not-about-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our most important work is not about technology</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Either we work on fixing these processes, or they will continue to eat our agile culture for breakfast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>
<p><span id="more-4767"></span></p>
<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4773" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" alt="Hendricks Chapel" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg 1024w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=768&amp;h=511 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4773" class="wp-caption-text">Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University</p></div></p>
<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>

<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" alt="should" width="480" height="255" /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about the challenges that face governments in acquiring and implementing new technology, the conversation eventually winds around to the procurement process.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when things usually get ugly. &#8220;It&#8217;s broken,&#8221; they say. &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>What most people who care about this issue fail to recognize, however, is that while the procurement process for technology may not work well for governments or prospective vendors (particularly smaller, younger companies), it is not broken. </p>
<p>It works exactly as it was designed to work.</p>
<p><span id="more-3861"></span></p>
<h4>Squeezing out the little guys</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a detailed account of what the government procurement process looks like from the perspective of a small startup, there is an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/18/why-govtech-is-broken/">interesting article in VentureBeat</a> that gives the account of <a href="http://tallyvoting.com/">TallyVoting</a> &#8211; a voting technology startup that is closing down after trying to penetrate the government market.</p>
<p>Here are some specific criticisms raised by the team behind TallyVoting.</p>
<p>The process moves too slowly&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
Governments move slowly compared to regular industry. Compared to the tech sector, government moves at a glacial pace. Selling stuff — not just technology — to government requires sourcing leads, submitting proposals and counter-proposals, securing external certification, periods for official and public comments, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The process is to costly and complex, particularly for smaller firms&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>
That long sales cycle doesn’t give a small bootstrapped startup a chance to demonstrate the potential of its concept and technology. (Unsurprisingly, the already-giant vendors with a stronghold on the market are more than able to handle this long cycle. They’re also more interested in profits than improvements and innovation.) It also doesn’t give the little startups the opportunity to show traction and product-market fit.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These are fair criticisms, but we often make the mistake in discussing them of assuming that they are unintended problems that arise through some general disfunction of government. </p>
<p>These issues are not accidental, and it&#8217;s time we reframed the discussion around procurement reform accordingly.</p>
<h4>The procurement process is too costly and complex</h4>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the government procurement process as it exists today is that it&#8217;s current design is largely intentional. Much like the federal and state income tax systems, we imbue a number of values deemed important into our procurement processes in the hopes of fostering desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Requirements for women and minority-owned business participation; requirements that governments utilize local vendors; requirements that governments favor vendors that have any number of different traits or qualities &#8211; no one would argue that these requirements are adopted in the hopes of fostering positive outcomes. But the price of using the procurement system as the vehicle for achieving these ends means that the process is more complex for all participants. </p>
<p>This is true, even if the positive outcomes are not realized, or realized to a lesser extent than hoped for. Much like with our tax system, the added complexity borne by all participants doesn&#8217;t guarantee the intended results.</p>
<p>Probably the most overarching value we imbue in the procurement system is risk aversion &#8211; in fact, much of the complexity and cost of the current system (for both governments and vendors) can be attributed to the desire to reduce the risk assumed by governments when partnering with outside firms to build or acquire technology.</p>
<p>Requirements like <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/civil/db/DBS/glossary.cgi?word=Proposal+Bond">proposal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_bond">performance bonds</a>, professional liability insurance coverage and the submission of audited financial statements (sometimes several years worth) &#8211; to name just a few &#8211; are all meant to offset the risk governments assume when they rely on a vendor. </p>
<p>In some respects, these requirements can be deemed beneficial to governments and indicate prudent stewardship of public resources. However, the widespread use of these and similar requirements by governments at all levels doesn&#8217;t seem to have lessened the incidence of IT project failures, and they can drive up the cost of technology projects by pricing smaller firms out of the bidding process. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard representatives of smaller firms argue that the bond industry doesn&#8217;t have a good understanding of how to underwrite technology projects, so it can be difficult to get a performance bond as part of a bid response. The result &#8211; many smaller firms that are well qualified to do the work may choose to simply walk away from the process. This is true even if these bond provisions don&#8217;t lower the actual risk assumed by governments as part of larger technology projects.</p>
<p>Again, the added complexity and cost borne by all participants can not guarantee the intended results. </p>
<p>A better much way for governments to hedge against the risks inherent in any large project &#8211; particularly technology projects &#8211; is to develop the internal capacity to manage and implement them successfully. Fortunately, we are starting to see this happen at the federal level with the creation of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">USDS</a>.</p>
<h4>The procurement process moves too slowly</h4>
<p>While this seems particularly acute in the procurement process, this is also a fair criticism of government in general.</p>
<p>We can make the same observation about the pace at which governments operate that we have about the procurement process &#8211; much of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._47">by design</a>. But long procurement and <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">budget cycles</a> can drive away smaller firms that can not afford to invest significant resources in projects that don&#8217;t provide a return for months on end.</p>
<p>There are usually requirements for government RFPs to be posted publicly and widely advertised, and rules that ensure all interested parties have an equal opportunity to participate through public bid notices and open vendor meetings. All of these requirements are meant to enhance the transparency of the bidding process but they can also add to the time it takes to select a vendor for a project, and for the vendor to actually begin work.</p>
<p>An emphasis on transparency in the procurement process is undoubtedly a good thing. But there are other steps that governments can take to dramatically enhance the transparency of the public procurement process without adding steps that slow the process down and discourage many prospective vendors from participating.</p>
<h4>Some things we can do to make procurement better</h4>
<p>With all of this in mind, here are &#8211; in no particular order &#8211; five suggested changes that can be adopted to improve the government procurement process.</p>
<p><strong>Raise the threshold on simplified / streamlined procurement</strong></p>
<p>Many governments use a separate, more streamlined process for smaller projects that do not require a full RFP. In the City of Philadelphia, professional services projects that do not exceed $32,000 annually go through this more streamlined bidding process. When I worked in Philly, we had some success in using these smaller projects to test <a href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/">new ideas and strategies</a> for partnering with small local vendors. There is much we can learn from these experiments, and a modest increase to enable more experimentation would allow governments to gain valuable new insights.</p>
<p><strong>Identify clear standards for projects</strong></p>
<p>Having a clear set of vendor-agnostic technology and data standards to use when developing RFPs and in performing work can make a huge difference in how a project turns out. Clearly articulating standards for:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom:5px;">
<li>The various components that a system will use.</li>
<li>The environment in which it will be housed.</li>
<li>The testing it must undergo prior to final acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;can go a long way to reduce the risk an uncertainly inherent in technology projects. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that most governments probably already have a set of standards that are usually made part of any technology solicitation. But these standards documents can quickly become out of date &#8211; they must undergo constant review and refinement.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the people writing these standards may confuse a specific vendor product or platform with a true standard. </p>
<p><strong>Require open source</strong></p>
<p>Requiring technology projects to be open source during development or after completion can be an effective way to reduce risk on an IT project and enhance transparency. This is particularly true of web-based projects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that every vendor needs to open source their entire platform, but if governments are contracting with outside companies to build new, custom software solutions &#8211; and there are no security or other considerations that would make it impractical &#8211; then why not make them open source?</p>
<p>Government RFPs should encourage the use of existing open source tools &#8211; leveraging existing software components that are in use in similar projects and maintained by an active community &#8211; to foster external participation by vendors and volunteers alike. When governments <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia">make the code behind their project open source</a>, they enable anyone that understands software development to help make them better.</p>
<p><strong>Develop internal capacity for IT project management and implementation</strong></p>
<p>Governments must find ways to develop the internal capacity for developing, implementing and managing technology projects.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that governments make use of a variety of different risk mitigation provisions in public bidding is that there is a lack of people in government (particularly at the state and local level) with hands on experience building or maintaining technology. There is a dearth of makers in government, and there is a direct relationship between the perceived risk that governments take on with new technology projects and the lack of experienced technologists working in government.</p>
<p>Governments need to find ways to develop a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker culture</a> within their workforces and should prioritize recruitment from the local technology and civic hacking communities. </p>
<p><strong>Make contracting, lobbying and campaign contribution data public as open data</strong></p>
<p>One of the more disheartening revelations to come out of the many postmortem reviews of the healthcare.gov implementation is that some of the firms that were awarded work as part of the project also <a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/aca-contractors/">spent non-trivial amounts of money on lobbying</a>. It&#8217;s a good bet that this kind of thing also happens at the state and local level as well.</p>
<p>This can seriously undermine confidence in the bidding process, and may cause many smaller firms &#8211; who lack funds or interest in lobbying elected officials &#8211; to simply throw up their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>In the absence of statutory or regulatory changes to prevent this from happening, governments can enhance the transparency around the bidding process by working to ensure that all contracting data as well as data listing publicly registered lobbyists and contributions to political campaigns is open.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all participants in the public bidding process have confidence that the process will be fair and transparent is essential to getting as many firms to participate as possible &#8211; including small firms more adept at agile software development methodologies. More bids typically equates to higher quality proposals and lower prices. </p>
<p>None of the changes list above will be easy, and governments are positioned differently in how well they may achieve any one of them. Nor do they represent the entire universe of things we can do to improve the system in the near term &#8211; these are items that I personally think are important and very achievable. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time for us to stop pretending that the problems with government technology procurement are an accident. </p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to fix things, we need to design a better system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to deriving useful results about the operation of government from open data sets, we have an enormous array of tools at our disposal that we can make use of. Often, we do not need sophisticated or expensive tools to produce useful results.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to use command line tools that are available on most laptops, and others that can be downloaded for free, to derive meaningful insights from a real government open data set. The following examples will leverage *nix-based tools like <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_%28Unix%29">tail</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(Unix)">sort</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq">uniq</a></code> and <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a></code> as well as open source tools that can be invoked from the command line like <code><a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.0/">csvkit</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></code>.</p>
<p>The data used in this post is from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Beginning-2008/q4hy-kbtf">NY State Open Data Portal</a> for traffic tickets issued in New York State from 2008 &#8211; 2012.</p>
<p><span id="more-3686"></span></p>
<p>I chose to download select portions of the data to my laptop in part so that I could play around with command line utilities, but also because I found the tools and options available on the data portal a bit clunky and difficult to use. This dataset is fairly large &#8211; around 18M rows &#8211; and manipulating it on the portal often seemed to take a long time (not really sure why). In addition, I felt like the data itself was so useful and compelling, I didn&#8217;t really need anything more than what I already had available to me in <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/15/5-essential-open-data-tools/">my own data toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve packaged up all of the data used in the following examples and saved them to a public Dropbox folder &#8211; you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l0xs6wo198npzy3/AACr5iXK5k8lHlarqPJZiVGWa?dl=0">get the data files here</a>, or simply download them directly from the NY Open Data Portal. (Note &#8211; the structure of the samples files in the Dropbox folder differs slightly from those that can be downloaded from the portal. For convenience, I separated records for specific years into separate files and removed the column titled <em>Violation Year</em>.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, if you decide to follow these examples you should read the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/api/views/q4hy-kbtf/files/qG3-cahBhdYsuQlMN8KrOrqEq_110cUjrUf4mt35TPM?download=true&amp;filename=NYSDMV_OpenData_Tickets_DataDictionary.pdf">metadata</a> and make sure you <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Beginning-2008/q4hy-kbtf/about">understand the limitations of the data</a>. Not all tickets &#8211; specifically for some violations in NYC &#8211; are included in this data set. Once we understand what the data includes, we can start to ask (and hopefully answer) some interesting questions.</p>
<p><strong>Q1: Are Men Better Drivers Than Women?</strong></p>
<p>There is a long held stereotype that men are better drivers than women.</p>
<p>The data on traffic tickets can help us to find out if there is any factual basis for such a claim, and once we have the data in hand we can use simple command line tools to start to work with it.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s count up the number of traffic tickets issued in NY State in 2012. To do this, we&#8217;ll use <code>tail</code> and <code>wc</code>.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012.csv | wc -l
 3524692
</pre>
<p>By using the <strong>+2</strong> with <code>tail</code>, we&#8217;re telling it to output the contents of the entire file starting on the second line in the file (to avoid counting the header row). We then pipe the output into <code>wc</code> and use the <strong>-l</strong> flag to indicate that we want to count the number of lines. Since each line in the file represents a ticket issued, we can see that there were more than 3.5 million tickets issued in NY State in 2012.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s repeat the process for 2011.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2011.csv | wc -l
 3643061
</pre>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that there were slightly fewer tickets issued in 2012 than in 2011 across the entire state (about 3.2% fewer in 2012).</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s count up the number of tickets issued based on the gender of the person ticketed. To do this, we&#8217;ll add some additional tools. We&#8217;ll use <code>csvcut</code> to separate out the 7th column in each line outputted by tail (which holds the value for gender), and then we&#8217;ll use <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> to total the number of unique values. When we use the <strong>-c</strong> flag with <code>uniq</code> it will tally up the counts for each unique value that we pipe to it.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012 | csvcut -c 7 | sort | uniq -c

17090 C
962450 F
2542324 M
2828 U
</pre>
<p>In this case, we can see that in addition to a value of <strong>M</strong> for males and <strong>F</strong> for females we have <strong>C</strong> and <strong>U</strong>. According to the <a href="///Users/mheadd/Downloads/NYSDMV_OpenData_Tickets_DataDictionary%20(1).pdf">data dictionary</a> from the NY Open Data Portal, a value of <strong>C </strong>indicates that the ticketed entity was an organization and a <strong>U</strong> indicates that the gender was unknown or not collected. Even if we assumed that all of the <strong>C</strong> and <strong>U</strong> rows were attributable to female drivers (which the most likely aren&#8217;t) we can see that the number of tickets issued to male drivers far outpaced females in 2012.</p>
<p>According to the NY State DMV, in 2012 female drivers accounted for <a href="http://dmv.ny.gov/statistic/2012lic.pdf"> about 49 percent of all licensed drivers</a> in the state. Our results show that female drivers accounted for only about 27% of all tickets issued in 2012, while men accounted for a whopping 73% during the same time period.</p>
<p>One issue with our data that we may want to correct before finalizing this observation is that it includes non-NY State drivers. We know what the proportion of men and women drivers is in NY State, but not for the population that received tickets in NY State in 2012 (which includes drivers from a large number of different states and territories). To find out how many of those drivers ticketed in 2012 were licensed in NY State, we need to introduce a new tool &#8211; <code>grep</code>.</p>
<pre>$ tail +2 violations2012.csv | csvcut -c 6 | grep -c "NEW YORK"

2902325
</pre>
<p>By following our previous example and using <code>csvcut</code> to extract the appropriate column (the one containing the state in which the driver is licensed), we can specify that we only want to count those rows where the value is equal to &#8220;NEW YORK&#8221;. We do this using the <strong>-c</strong> flag of <code>grep</code>, which works much like the one we used for <code>uniq</code> above.</p>
<p>Now we can combine both approaches and count up the number of tickets issued by the gender of the ticket recipient for drivers licensed in NY State.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012.csv \
&gt; | csvcut -c 6,7 \
&gt; | grep "NEW YORK" \
&gt; | csvcut -c 2 \
&gt; | sort \
&gt; | uniq -c

 620 C
829695 F
2070547 M
1463 U
</pre>
<p>Note that we use <code>csvcut</code> twice in this example. We first use it to extract the columns that contain the gender of the recipient and the state in which they are licensed (we do this by using the <strong>-c</strong> flag and indicating the two columns we are interested in). We then pipe the output of that operation to <code>grep</code> to select only those that have &#8220;NEW YORK&#8221; and then again pass it to <code>csvcut</code> to single out the column holding the value for gender.</p>
<p>Our results don&#8217;t change all that much, and we can conclude with some confidence &#8211; if getting ticketed for a traffic violation is a good proxy for driving skill &#8211; that women are much better drivers than men.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to delve deeper into this data.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Which Police Agencies Issue the Most Tickets?</strong></p>
<p>To find out which police agencies issue the most tickets &#8211; and, maybe more interestingly, how the number of tickets issued changed from 2011 to 2012 &#8211; we&#8217;ll introduce a relational database to the mix</p>
<p>For the following examples I&#8217;ll use MySQL and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/b1eb45ab74cccd05abf8">very simple import script</a> to bring the data from the CSV files we have been working with into a database. But you can use any database tool that you want to do something similar. If you don&#8217;t have MySQL installed, you can download it <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s create the MySQL database and import our CSV files.</p>
<pre>~$ mysql -u username &lt; path/to/violations.sql
</pre>
<p>Next, we log into the MySQL CLI and start using the new <code>violations</code> database that we just created.</p>
<pre>~$ mysql -u username
mysql&gt; use violations;
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s sum up the number of tickets issued by police agency in 2012 for the top 10 agencies.</p>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT Police_Agency AS 'Agency', SUM(1) AS 'Number' FROM _2012 
    -&gt; GROUP BY Police_Agency 
    -&gt; ORDER BY Number DESC 
    -&gt; LIMIT 10;
+----------------------------+---------+
| Agency                     | Number  |
+----------------------------+---------+
| NYC PD                     | 1041037 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  PD      |  177551 |
| COUNTY OF NASSAU  PD       |  148919 |
| CITY OF ROCHESTER PD       |   33765 |
| FARMINGDALE STATE POLICE   |   32842 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  SHERIFF |   31972 |
| MIDDLETOWN STATE POLICE    |   31563 |
| COUNTY OF MONROE SHERIFF   |   30799 |
| ROCHESTER STATE POLICE     |   30354 |
| CITY OF SYRACUSE PD        |   30247 |
+----------------------------+---------+
10 rows in set (3.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>These results aren&#8217;t all that surprising &#8211; in terms of raw numbers, we would expect to see the NYC police, larger downstate counties and the big cities upstate in the top 10 list. We can also do the same thing for 2011.</p>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT Police_Agency AS 'Agency', SUM(1) AS 'Number' FROM _2011 
    -&gt; GROUP BY Police_Agency 
    -&gt; ORDER BY Number DESC 
    -&gt; LIMIT 10;
+-------------------------------+---------+
| Agency                        | Number  |
+-------------------------------+---------+
| NYC PD                        | 1060588 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  PD         |  161276 |
| COUNTY OF NASSAU  PD          |  146046 |
| CITY OF ROCHESTER PD          |   34443 |
| MIDDLETOWN STATE POLICE       |   33702 |
| CITY OF SYRACUSE PD           |   33415 |
| TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE TUNNEL AUTH |   32214 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  SHERIFF    |   31788 |
| FARMINGDALE STATE POLICE      |   31187 |
| COUNTY OF MONROE SHERIFF      |   30386 |
+-------------------------------+---------+
10 rows in set (3.19 sec)
</pre>
<p>Interesting to note that the City of Syracuse PD has seen pretty dramatic drop off in tickets from 2011 to 2012 (a drop of almost 10 percent). But what I really want to do is to look at all police agencies and compare 2012 to the previous year to see how the number of tickets issued has changed for each.</p>
<p>The most convenient tool to make this kind of comparison and to sort results would probably be a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Docs). To import into either of those, we&#8217;ll need a CSV file with the total number of tickets issued by each police agency for both years.</p>
<p>To generate this CSV file, we can leverage MySQL by passing in a simple SQL query to the MySQL CLI and then use the <code>sed</code> tool to filter the results. Specifically, when the MySQL CLI outputs the results they will be tab delimited. We want to replace the tabs with commas and then direct the results to an output file. We use the following command to generate the results for 2012.</p>
<pre>echo "use violations; select Police_Agency as 'Agency', SUM(1) as '2012 Number' from _2012 group by Agency;" \
| mysql -u username \
| sed 's/	/,/g' \
&gt; agency_counts_1.csv
</pre>
<p>And we repeat the process for 2011 results.</p>
<pre>echo "use violations; select Police_Agency as 'Agency', SUM(1) as '2011 Number' from _2011 group by Agency;" \
| mysql -u username \
| sed 's/	/,/g' \
&gt; agency_counts_2.csv
</pre>
<p>Next we&#8217;ll use <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/csvjoin.html"><code>csvjoin</code></a> to combine the files and match up the rows holding results for police agencies from 2012 and 2011 into a file called <code>agency_counts.csv</code>.</p>
<pre>csvjoin -c "Agency,Agency" agency_counts_1.csv agency_counts_2.csv &gt; agency_counts.csv
</pre>
<p>We can now open this file in Excel or Google Docs and refine it a bit.</p>
<p>When we joined the two CSV files above, it created a superfluous column called <strong>Agency</strong> &#8211; we can remove this column, calculate the difference in tickets issued between years, sort them and we get results that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5l4cCrasb73D91cqxP3_6zvwUWDWnoFvgdfwEvl3XA/edit#gid=556461661">look like this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Results</strong></p>
<p>By sorting this spreadsheet on the <em># Difference</em> column we can see some interesting things. Overall, tickets issued in NY State went down in 2012 over 2011, but for some police agencies the number of tickets issued went up dramatically. In Western New York, both of the Buffalo area police agencies saw dramatic increases in the number of tickets issued. On the eastern side of the state, the Albany PD saw a dramatic increase in tickets, and Downstate the suffolk County PD saw a healthy increase.</p>
<p>What caused these results? Was there something significant in the type of traffic violations issued by these agencies? Was there something important about the time of year (or the time of day) that they were issued? To find out, we&#8217;ll need to do more analysis, which is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>What I hoped to show is that some of the most powerful data tools are widely available, easy to use command line utilities. When it comes to deriving useful results about the operation of government from data sets, we have an enormous array of tools at our disposal to use. Often, we do not need sophisticated or expensive tools to produce useful results.</p>
<p>We just need good data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s really interesting to see <a href="https://government.github.com/community/">so many governments</a> start to use GitHub as a platform for sharing both code and data. One of the things I find interesting, though, is how infrequently governments use standard licenses with their data and app releases on GitHub.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m as <a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/499689634373570560">guilty as anyone</a> of pushing government data and apps to GitHub without proper terms of use, or a standard license. Adding these to a repo can be a pain &#8211; more often than not, I used to find my self rooting around in older repos looking for a set of terms that I could include in a repo I wanted to create and copying it. This isn&#8217;t a terrible way ensure that terms of use for government data and apps stay consistent, but I think we can do better.</p>
<p>Before leaving the City of Philadelphia, I began experimenting with a new approach. I created a <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/terms-of-use">stand-alone repository</a> for our most commonly used set of terms &amp; conditions. Then, I added the license to a new project as a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules">submodule</a>. With this approach, we can ensure that every time a set of terms &amp; conditions is included with a repo containing city data or apps that the language is up to date and consistent with what is being used in other repos.</p>
<p>Adding the terms of use to a new repo before making it public is easy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
~$ git submodule add git://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/terms-of-use.git license
</p></blockquote>
<p>This adds a new subdirectory in the parent repo named &#8216;license&#8217; that contains a reference to the repo holding the license language. Any user cloning the repo to use the data or app, simply does (for purposes of demonstration, using <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-polling-loctions">this</a> rep):</p>
<blockquote><p>
~$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-polling-loctions" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-polling-loctions</a><br />
~$ git submodule init<br />
~$ git submodule update
</p></blockquote>
<p>The user can run <strong>git submodule update</strong> any time to get the very latest license language, which can change from time to time.</p>
<p>Github is an amazing platform for governments to use in sharing open data and fostering collaboration through releasing applications as open source projects. </p>
<p>I think it also provides some powerful facilities for associating licenses and terms &amp; conditions with these releases &#8211; something every open source project needs to be sustainable and successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on <a href="https://civic.io/2014/08/11/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-government-apis/">my last post</a>, and a recent trip to St. Paul Minnesota for the NAGW Annual Conference to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a5QtYxB1GOt1WuaNxXEIf85evyXnzv7XIQ5-v7FPaRU/edit#slide=id.p15">talk about open data APIs</a>, I wanted to provide a few insights for proper API stewardship for any government looking to get started with open data, or those that already have an open data program underway.</p>
<p>Implementing an API for your open data is <a href="https://civic.io/2012/03/21/to-api-or-not-to-api/">not a trivial undertaking</a>, and even if this is a function that you outsource to a vendor or partner it&#8217;s useful to understand some of the issues and challenges involved.</p>
<p>This is something that the open data team in the City of Philadelphia <a href="http://phillyinnovates.com/2014/03/11/developing-an-open-data-api-strategy/">researched extensively</a> during my time there, and this issue continues to be among the most important for any government embarking on an open data program.</p>
<p>In no particular order, here are some of the things that I think are important for proper API stewardship. </p>
<p><strong>Implement Rate Limiting</strong></p>
<p>APIs are shared resources, and one consumer&#8217;s use of an API can potentially impact anther consumer. Implementing rate limiting ensures that one consumer doesn&#8217;t crowd out others by trying to obtain large amounts of data through your API (that&#8217;s what bulk downloads are for).</p>
<p>If you want to start playing around with rate limiting for your API, have a look at <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</a> &#8211; an open source web proxy that makes it <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html">super easy</a> to implement rate limits on your API. I use Nginx as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy</a> for pretty much every public facing API I work on. It&#8217;s got a <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Modules">ton of great features</a> that make it ideal for front ending your APIs.</p>
<p>Depending on the user base for your API, you <a href="https://civic.io/2014/03/07/apis-to-charge-or-not-to-charge/">may also want to consider using pricing</a> as a mechanism for managing access to your API.</p>
<p><strong>Provide Bulk Data</strong></p>
<p>If the kind of data you are serving through your API is also the kind that consumers are going to want to get in bulk, you should make it available as a static &#8211; but regularly updated &#8211; download (in addition to making it available through your API). </p>
<p>In my experience, APIs are a lousy way to get bulk data &#8211; consumers would much rather get it as a compressed file they can download and use without fuss, and making consumers get bulk data through your API simply burdens it with unneeded traffic and ties up resources that can affect other consumers&#8217; experience using your API.</p>
<p>If your serving up open data through your API, here are <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/10/02/government-apis-arent-a-backup-plan/">some additional reasons</a> that you should also make this data available in bulk.</p>
<p><strong>Use a Proxy Cache</strong></p>
<p>A proxy cache sits in between your API and those using it, and caches responses that are frequently requested. Depending on the nature of the data you are serving through your API, it might be desirable to cache responses for some period of time &#8211; even up to 24 hours.</p>
<p>For example, an API serving <a href="http://phlapi.com/opaapi.html">property data</a> might only be updated when property values are adjusted &#8211; either through a reassessment or an appeal by a homeowner. An API serving tax data might only be updated on a weekly basis. The caching strategy you employ with your open data API should be a good fit for the frequency with which the data behind it is updated.</p>
<p>If the data is only updated on a weekly basis, there is little sense in serving every single request to your API through a fresh call down the stack to the application and database running it. It&#8217;s more beneficial for the API owner, and the API consumer, if these requests are served out of cache.</p>
<p>There are lots of good choices for standing up a proxy cache like <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> or <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>. These tools are open source, easy to use and can make a huge difference in the performance of your API.</p>
<p><strong>Always Send Caching Instructions to API Consumers</strong></p>
<p>If your API supports <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> then it will serve data directly to web browsers. An extension of the cacheing strategy discussed above should address cache headers that are returned to browser-based apps that will consume data from your API.</p>
<p>There are lots of good resources providing details of how to effectively employ cache headers like <a href="http://www.mobify.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-http-cache-headers/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/">this</a>. Use them.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate tradeoffs of using ETags</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag">ETags</a> are related to the cacheing discussion detailed above. In a nutshell, ETags enable your API consumers to make &#8220;conditional&#8221; requests for data. </p>
<p>When ETags are in use, API responses are returned to consumers with a unique representation of a resource (an ETag). When the resource changes &#8211; i.e., is updated &#8211; the ETag for that resource will change. A client can make subsequent requests for the same resource and include the original ETag in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.26">special HTTP header</a>. If the resource has changed since the last request, the API will return the updated resource (with an HTTP 200 response, and the new ETag). This ensures that the API consumer always gets the latest version of a resource.</p>
<p>If the resource hasn&#8217;t changed since the last request, the API will instead return a response indicating that the resource was not modified (an HTTP 304 response). When the API sends back this response to the consumer, the content of the resource is not included, meaning the transaction is less &#8220;expensive&#8221; because what is actually sent back as a response from the API is smaller in size. This does not, however, meant that your API doesn&#8217;t expend resources when ETgas are used.</p>
<p>Generating ETags and checking them against those sent with each API call will consume resources and can be rather expensive depending on how your API implements ETags. Even if what gets sent over the wire is more compact, the client response will be slowed down by the need to match ETags submitted with API calls, and this response will probably always be slower than sending a response from a proxy cache or simply dipping into local cache (in instances where a browser is making the API call).</p>
<p>Also, if you are rate limiting your API does responses that generate an HTTP 304 count against an individual API consumer&#8217;s limit? <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/ads-api/etags-reference">Some APIs</a> work this way.</p>
<p>Some examples of how ETags work using CouchDB &#8211; which has a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API#ETags.2FCaching">pretty easy to understand</a> ETags implementation &#8211; can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/6cf2ef0ca33ae0721f38">here</a>.</p>
