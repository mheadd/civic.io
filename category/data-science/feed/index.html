										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>

<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>

" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4774" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" alt="Delaware State Senate Chamber" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=2000 2000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /><p id="caption-attachment-4774" class="wp-caption-text">Delaware State Senate Chamber, Dover DE</p></div>
<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=1000" alt="should"   /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

<p id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve had the opportunity recently to talk to people in several different city governments that are facing a common challenge — <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">how to liberate operational data from a legacy system</span>.</p>
<p id="fdb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a challenge that lots of city governments face, and it strikes me that there are some common lessons that can be derived from cities that have gone down this road already for those that are still trying to figure out the right approach.</p>
<p id="0867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following suggestions are crafted from my own experience as a municipal government official charged with making data more widely available, and those of people in similar positions that I’ve had a chance to speak with.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4739"></span></p>
<p id="538a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope this helps someone in a city government that is currently facing this challenge.</p>
<h3 id="a933" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem</h3>
<p id="08fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’ve got operational data in a legacy system that you want to make more easily available to users inside of (and outside of) your city government.</p>
<p id="8565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may be a part of a larger data or analytics strategy that is spinning up, or a one-off request from the Mayor or other political leader for a specific project. Regardless of how it landed in your lap, the job is yours now.</p>
<p id="9a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">You’ve got to figure out the best way to provide access to data in a legacy system in a way that is both useful for others and maintainable by you</span>.</p>
<h3 id="fde9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Some Hurdles You’ll Face</h3>
<p id="0982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You probably won’t have additional resources allocated to support this project, and if the system in question is a bespoke solution created by a vendor they may want to charge you a handsome sum to do the work for you.</p>
<p id="e88e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is one of the first projects you’re undertaking to get operational data out of a legacy system for other purposes, you may not have a lot of the policy and technology infrastructure in place to support what you want to do. In a way this is a good thing — you have a greenfield opportunity to help shape policy and set up infrastructure that can be used to support a broader data strategy for your city. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to figure out what you need to get the job done on your own. As issues or questions arise, It will be your job to figure out how to address them.</p>
<p id="ca37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, you’ll have to make some definite choices technology wise. The good news is there are lots of different options for liberating data in legacy systems, and many are low cost and leverage open source software. However, different solutions may require different levels of technical expertise — some or all of which may be absent from your current IT environment. You’ll need to figure out how to introduce some new tools to your environment and — hopefully — keep them aligned with the skill sets of your staff and consistent with established IT policies.</p>
<p id="f1a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With these challenges in mind, here is a description of one approach that cities are using to take data from a legacy system and make it more easily usable by people inside and outside city government.</p>
<h3 id="548b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Extract, Transform, Load</h3>
<p id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first step in liberating data from a legacy system is to make a copy of it.</p>
<p id="a382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This seems pretty straightforward but it’s worth emphasizing as you consider how to get started. The use of your data for analytics and other purposes should occur outside of the environment your legacy system is currently running in.</p>
<p id="7b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your goal here is to make a separate copy of your production data that is stored outside of the production system that is using it. You want this copy to be as close to identical to your production data as possible (with the caveat that there there may be data in your legacy system that is not appropriate to share, or that is unable to be shred because of existing policy). And since regular usage of your production system will cause your copy to become stale over time, you want to make the process of generating a copy repeatable at regular (preferable short) intervals.</p>
<p id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sequence of steps is generally referred to in the world of data management as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). It’s a common need and there are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to do it well. That said, it can be difficult to cut through the noise around ETL, sift through the competing options, and select an approach or solution that is affordable and maintainable. Additionally, for governments that have a heterogeneous technology environment with lots of different legacy systems, more than one ETL approach may be required.</p>
<p id="0e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluating the ETL lifecycle in reverse can be a helpful way work through the issues:</p>
<h4 id="7cb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Load</h4>
<p id="ab7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Where are you going to put your data once you get it out of your legacy system?</p>
<p id="38fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational database platform (RDBMS) of some flavor probably makes the most sense. You can use an RDBMS with a whole bunch of commercially available reporting tools, and an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://redash.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increasing</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/ankane/blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">number</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.cluvio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud-based</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> tools. You can also use it to build an API (more on this below).</p>
<p id="f75b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Already got a database environment and licenses? You’re probably good to go. If not, think about where you’re going to house your data (on a machine racked in your data center, or somewhere in the cloud) and select a database solution that is a good fit for your current IT environment and employee’s skill sets.</p>
<h4 id="6173" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transform</h4>
<p id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The amount of transformation you’ll need to do on your data before loading it will depend on the system it is coming from. If your legacy data is already in an RDBMS you might be able to skip over this step and simply replicate from your production database to a backup.</p>
<p id="647a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, particularly if your data is in an older legacy system, you may need to extract it into an intermediate format (e.g., CSV) and alter it before loading it into another database. This is almost always a pretty solid approach — there are lots of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tools</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/scripts/csvsql.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a> for managing and manipulating these kinds of files, and for loading them into an RDBMS. These tools are scriptable and can be automated, making them easy to drop into your ETL toolchain.</p>
<p id="41d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If extracts from your legacy system are initially going to be infrequent (once a month or once a week) then you may be able to work through this process manually at first. As extracts become more frequent, you can start automating it incrementally, with the goal of having regular, frequent extracts occurring in a completed automated way.</p>
<h4 id="c169" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extract</h4>
<p id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the part of the ETL process that you don’t get to choose. Your data is in the system that it’s in — your challenge is to get it out of that system in a way that won’t disrupt its current operation and that is maintainable by you and/or other city IT staff.</p>
<p id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your data is already in an RDBMS, then there are undoubtedly utilities available to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replicate</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sqlserverdump.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backup</a> data (hopefully you are already using them). You should evaluate these options to decide which is best given your current scenario.</p>
<p id="9240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It your data is in an older system like an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/industry_insiders/2008/10/01/sql-server-using-ssis-to-retrieve-data-from-as400/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AS/400</a> or a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3438/importing-mainframe-data-with-sql-server-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mainframe system</a>, you may need to create a custom solution for extracting data. If you have vendors supporting these systems, you can inquire about potential approaches and pricing. But keep in mind — these systems are pretty common in municipal government. Your counterparts in other local governments face this same challenge and some have already figured out how to do it efficiently. Communicating with other government IT officials might be one of your most effective mechanism for extracting data from older legacy systems.</p>
<p id="ef6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve identified an ETL approach that works for you, you will have a copy of your production data in a separate system that is now ready to use. Depending on who wants to use this data, and how they want to use it, you’ll have several options for what to do next.</p>
<h3 id="fbe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Making Use of Your Data</h3>
<p id="47a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Replicating production data so that people in operation and policy offices can run reports is a pretty common use case. If this was the driver for liberating your data from a legacy system, then most of what remains is simply pointing your reporting tool of choice at your newly created database.</p>
<p id="2d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if you want to enable other uses for your data — e.g., using it to support a custom dashboard or application — or if you’re not sure what all of the uses for your data will be — you have some more decisions to make.</p>
<p id="362b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option that you have is to put your data in an open data platform. If your data liberation work is part of a larger effort to make data more accessible to external users, you may already have one of these (or you may soon be getting one). If not, then you can still use an open data platform to house your data for use in internal reporting, analytics and application development. There are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/10/open-data-portal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots of commercial and open source options</a> that can be run both on premise and in the cloud.</p>
<p id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to create an API for your data. This will allow you to tailor the way that users can access the data in a way that most effectively matches their use case. This option will, however, require you to make some technology choices.</p>
<p id="78f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every modern programming language has frameworks for building APIs, and odds are that you’ve already got some APIs running in your current IT environment (even if you didn’t build them). If your IT organization is a Microsoft shop (which is pretty common in municipal government), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">there are</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">great</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">options</a> for you to use to build an API. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform provides some nice options for hosting your data or your API application, as well as for <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p id="1a3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluate the options that most closely align with your current environment and that are a good fit for the talents of your existing IT staff, because odds are they are the ones that will have to manage it going forward.</p>
<h3 id="dbc6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Comes Next?</h3>
<p id="ff5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Whether you’ve put your data in an open data portal or created a standalone API, you now have an interface that you can manage that allows people to access your data. There are a few things you’ll need to think about to manage it effectively in the long run:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="aa24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who gets to use your API? Will they be required to authenticate to use it, or provide a key with calls to your API?</li>
<li id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you open up access to your API to a select group of users (e.g., those on your internal network, or at a specific IP range) or will it be available more broadly, for anyone to use?</li>
<li id="8d13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you manage traffic to your API to prevent abuse or overuse by specific users?</li>
<li id="cd97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you monitor your API to ensure it is up and operating properly?</li>
<li id="170f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you log requests to your API and do regular diagnostics?</li>
</ul>
<p id="c71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond general management of your API, (whether you realize it or not) you’re also going to need to provide some support for users of your API:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Will you provide examples to users for how they can make calls and get data from your API?</li>
<li id="5586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who do users contact if they are having a problem using your API?</li>
<li id="8a6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where do users go to ask questions, or learn more about how to use your API?</li>
<li id="723f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will users (internal or external) be able to suggest changes or enhancements to your API?</li>
</ul>
<p id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot to consider for a project that you may not have explicitly chosen to undertake in the first place.</p>
<p id="657b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re working with a vendor that has provided an open data portal, many of the things listed above may be in place already. And your vendor will likely have experience working with other customers — when in doubt ask your vendor to provide you with examples of how other customers are addressing a common issue.</p>
<p id="259b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve built a custom API, here are a few tips to you get started thinking about the issues listed above:</p>
<h4 id="3bc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lend users a hand</h4>
<p id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provide users with enough information to get them started using your API without having the have a human help them. Your IT staff will thank you.</p>
<p id="42a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invest some time in creating user facing materials with examples of how to make calls to your API, and a list of frequently asked questions. The more information you provide up front that makes it easy for users to start using your API the less phone calls and emails you’ll need to respond to.</p>
<p id="11b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, set up a way for users to report issues — a shared email box that is checked regularly is a good way to get started.</p>
<p id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up a way to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.runscope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">monitor the uptime of your API</a> so you’ll know when it’s down. This will allow you to get it back up quickly and also <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communicate to users</a> that you are aware of the problem (again, resulting in fewer phone calls and emails).</p>
<h4 id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Treat your API like a shared resource</h4>
<p id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You should treat an API like a shared resource because that’s exactly what it is — improperly managed, one consumers overuse of this resource can crowd out the legitimate use of others.</p>
<p id="36d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requiring authentication for users is one way to keep track of who is using your API, and issuing API keys is another option. Keep in mind, though, that if users can’t sign up quickly and easily without human intervention, then your phone will start to ring (or your inbox will start to fill up).</p>
<p id="999e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should strongly consider a way to rate limit usage of your API — there are a number of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commercial</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://getkong.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> API tools that can help you do this. You should also give thought to a caching strategy to improve the performance of your API — this includes not only setting up a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proxy cache</a>but also sending the appropriate <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caching headers</a> with your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="1415" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Plan for the future</h4>
<p id="8630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As your API gets used, the people using it will form opinions about what they like and what they don’t like. Give them a way to provide this input to you in a way that you can refer back to. This will help you prioritize changes and enhancements to your API going forward and ensure you are directing your finite resources to the things your users want most.</p>
<p id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll also want to think about things like versioning your API to allow you to gracefully deprecate features and add new ones.</p>
<p id="d14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data APIs are increasingly common in government, and there are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/application-programming-interfaces-apis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> that can help you work through these issues.</p>
<p id="6c6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge of getting operational data from a legacy system and using it to support an internal analytics project, or an external open data effort are increasingly common in municipal government. You’ll face challenges in getting started, but you can take comfort in knowing that lots of other local government IT leaders are traveling this same road. Sharing your experience and asking others to share theirs is an effective way of working through these issues.</p>
<p id="f989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t let the fact that you don’t know everything keep you from doing the things you can do right now.</p>

<p id="06dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These tools are more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.livestories.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plentiful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">powerful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://quickcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">flexible</a>, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://dataship.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive</a> than pretty much everything government employees currently have at their disposal. Governments may have exiting relationships with huge tech companies like Microsoft, IBM, Esri and others that have an array of different data tools — it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p id="6033" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the race for better data tools, the general public isn‘t just beating out the public sector, its already won the race and is taking a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/12760040/revisiting-bruce-jenner-historic-olympic-victory-1976-montreal-games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jenner-esque victory lap</a>.</p>
<p id="379c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This isn’t a new trend.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4714"></span></p>
<p id="6858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a time when making a map on the internet required specialized skills and proprietary tools. Then along came <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Maps</a>. Now tools like<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mapbox</a>, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://carto.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Carto</a> and many others have democratized mapmaking, and — in many ways — given citizen map makers more powerful and easier to use tools than government employees have.</p>
<p id="86ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m emphasizing a point that is pretty obvious but for people that work inside government this has some implications. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">The process of using data to improve the way governments work is inextricably linked to how good governments are at engaging with outside data users.</span></p>
<p id="bcb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public sector employees that want to use data to improve how government operates, enhance the quality of public services or help governments make better decisions will need to employ a new set of skills. It won’t be good enough to simply enhance internal capacity for data analysis or app development (although that’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://kcmo.gov/data/2016/09/12/data-data-data-introducing-kansas-citys-data-academy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pretty important</a> as well).</p>
<p id="4502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help them direct the efforts of outside volunteers to issues or challenges that can have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff.</span> They’ll need to learn how to rally people to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies.</p>
<p id="f811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is often a relatively new skill set for those in government IT departments and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@mheadd/bridging-the-citistat-gap-ef563328593f#.e7ofan41f" target="_blank">PerformanceStat programs</a> — where government data efforts commonly reside. These departments are typically inward facing — serving the needs of other agencies — and often don’t have long traditions of outside engagement.</p>
<p id="0f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Its time for governments to reimagine their place in the civic technology production chain. More than ever, it is essential that governments assume their role as data stewards, enablers and conveners to bring the power of these new external tools to bear on the problems facing our communities.</p>
<p id="68be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">For governments, outside engagement will turn out to be the most important new tool in the 21st Century data science toolkit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Last August, a </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">study from the Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> identified cities in Upstate New York as places with some of the highest concentrations of poverty for African American and Hispanic populations anywhere in the nation. The problem is particularly acute in the City of Syracuse which holds the  distinction of having the highest level of poverty concentration among African American and Hispanic populations of the one hundred largest metropolitan areas in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This problem isn’t Syracuse’s alone &#8211; the study shows that Rochester and Buffalo also have serious problems with concentrated poverty. But the Salt City is an unfortunate standout in this report. In addition to have the highest concentrations of poverty among African Americans and Hispanics, when looking at concentrated poverty among non-Hispanic whites “&#8230;Detroit, Fresno, and Syracuse are the only metropolitan areas on all three lists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Century Foundation&#8217;s findings echo those of an </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">earlier study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with a similar scope conducted by CNY Fair Housing, Inc. which found that the Syracuse area is “one of the worst scoring cities in the country when looking at equality of opportunity based on race and ethnicity.” Given what we know about how </span><a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods"><span style="font-weight:400;">concentrated poverty affects the life outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for people who live in it, it’s hard to imagine a more serious drag on the growth and well being of our region than deliberately forcing people to live in places where they are surrounded by poverty and given them few options of getting out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But that’s exactly what we do.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4675"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8230;[W]e are witnessing a nationwide return of concentrated poverty that is racial in nature, and &#8230; this expansion and continued existence of high-poverty ghettos and barrios is no accident. These neighborhoods are not the value-free outcome of the impartial workings of the housing market. Rather, in large measure, they are the inevitable and predictable consequences of deliberate policy choices.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8212; Paul Jargowsky, the Architecture of Segregation</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Syracuse&#8217;s issues with poverty and neighborhood decline are not an accident. Like many other cities, Syracuse still shows the scars of <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/HOLC_Maps.htm">redlining</a> and other discriminatory practices that prevented investment in specific neighborhoods deemed at the time to be undesirable. Looking at <a href="http://syracusethenandnow.org/Redlining/OldRedlining/HOLC_Maps/Syracuse%201937%20Redline%20Map.pdf">redline maps of Syracuse from the 1930&#8217;s</a> shows a disturbing correlation with neighborhoods that are now struggling with concentrated poverty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our contemporary problems with poverty in Central New York are also not accidental &#8211; they are the result of conscious policy decisions made by government officials in our region and are further amplified by federal and state tax policy. The cumulative impact of these policies has left the Central New York region </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/11/report_syracuse_and_onondaga_county_suffer_from_hyper-segregation.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">deeply segregated</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and with unrivaled levels of concentrated poverty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Improving our community will require us not only to understand how these policy decisions are made and how they contribute to the concentration of poverty, it will require those of us in Central New York not living in areas of high poverty to understand how we are complicit in these decisions. But even beyond this, reversing the concentration of poverty in our region will require political courage and strong leadership from county, state and federal officials.</span></p>
<p><b>The Cost of Complexity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Commission on Local Government Consolidation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (the Consensus Commission) issued a </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/docs/1.26.16_Consensus_PRELIM_RECCS_REPORT.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">preliminary report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> outlining some options for streamlining the administration of local government in Central New York. Under the unifying theme of “we can do better” the Commission listed a host of different areas where local services are duplicative and wasteful. A community wide discussion on the potential benefits of government consolidation has ensued. Though the issue of concentrated poverty is touched on briefly in the Consensus Commission report, one of the primary factors contributing to the problem is buried near the end and not deeply examined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Land use planning (discussed on page 69 of the Consensus Commission report) &#8211; the rules governing what kinds of structures and buildings get built in our community, and where they may be located &#8211; is highly decentralized in Onondaga County, scattered across many local jurisdictions. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">In total, we estimate that more than 550 board members are involved in land use and planning activities across Onondaga County – nearly 200 municipal board members, 195 planning board members, and 169 zoning board members. Each municipality possesses its own zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations, and other local laws / ordinances related to planning.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Commission on Local Government Modernization, Options Report &amp; Preliminary Committee Recommendations</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even more important, there is a lack of a comprehensive, enforceable land use plan for the entire county to guide this vast collection of local officials. This means that each local governments in Onondaga County has latitude for establishing its own set of rules for land use within its jurisdiction, with no enforceable central coordination at the county or regional level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is a recipe for </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/facts/understanding-exclusionary-zoning-impact-concentrated-poverty/"><span style="font-weight:400;">exclusionary zoning practices</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, which occur when wealthier suburban jurisdictions enact land use restrictions that drive up the cost of housing and crowd out affordable accommodations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Traditionally, exclusionary zoning policies have kept poor, central city residents out of suburbs with minimum lot size requirements, single residence per lot requirements, minimum square footage requirements, and costly building codes. Together, these requirements make it difficult to build multi-family rental units that would allow lower-income residents to live in wealthy suburban developments with access to quality schools and employment.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; Elliott Anne Rigsby, Understanding Exclusionary Zoning and Its Impact on Concentrated Poverty</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, low-income residents are priced out of the suburbs by land use decisions that get made by a decentralized collection of small local boards. It is the collective impact of these parochial decisions that has resulted the level of concentrated poverty we see in Syracuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This issue was raised long before the Consensus Commission report, and before the Century Foundation report singled out Syracuse for its unmatched level of concentrated poverty. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">In a 2014, the </span><a href="http://media.syracuse.com/news/other/2014/11/17/CNY-Fair-Housing-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">CNY Fair Housing, Inc. study</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> found that</span><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8230;in many parts of the county, exclusionary zoning policies exist that drive up the cost of developing new housing. This includes large minimum lot size or coverage requirements.  In addition, the County has identified that the lack of uniform procedures among the 34 municipalities within the County Consortium increases the cost of developing housing. This lack of uniformity also reduces transparency in the system, making it more difficult to monitor how the municipalities are working to further fair housing.</span></i></p>
<p><em>&#8212; CNY Fair Housing, Analysis of impediments to Fair Housing</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Concentrated poverty in Syracuse is not new &#8211; the problem has festered and deepened over decades (particularly over the last decade and a half according to the Century Foundation report). It is also not accidental &#8211; the cumulative impact of local land use decisions made by hundreds of different local officials in isolation and tax benefits enjoyed disproportionately by residents in wealthier suburban areas all contribute to the severity of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We all carry some of the blame for pushing our community to the brink. </span></p>
<p><b>Subsidizing Poverty</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/architecture-of-segregation/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Century Foundation Report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> provides a clear (and disturbing) picture of concentrated poverty in </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse &#8211; but this only shows one part of the picture. Exclusionary zoning practices and suburban subsidization drives up the cost of home ownership outside of the City of Syracuse &#8211; putting it out of reach for low and moderate income families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using data from </span><a href="http://www.zillow.com/research/data/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Zillow</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, we can get a glimpse of the rest of the picture, and clearly see the disparity in homeownership costs between the poorer sections of the City of Syracuse and more wealth suburban towns and villages.</span></p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/793dbc1a-3c94-11e6-9457-0ecfd53eb7d3/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/793dbc1a-3c94-11e6-9457-0ecfd53eb7d3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">This map shows median home values</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by zip code in Onondaga County as of May 31, 2016. With this view, we get a clearer picture of the impact of exclusionary zoning outside the urban center &#8211; median home values in the suburbs far outpace those in the city. To illustrate this point, consider the <strong>13205</strong> zip code (which encompasses the South side of the City of Syracuse) and the directly adjacent <strong>13078</strong> zip code (which covers the Town of DeWitt). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Median home values in the <strong>13205</strong> zip code in May of this year was $62,500 while those in the <strong>13078</strong> zip code was $225,000 &#8211; a difference of over 350%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s worse &#8211; the impact of exclusionary zoning gets magnified by federal and state tax policies that allow wealthier homeowners to deduct things like </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p936.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and local real estate taxes. These benefits are used disproportionately by higher income taxpayers and provide bigger benefits for homeowners with larger mortgages and bigger tax bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Using </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi"><span style="font-weight:400;">zip code data from the IRS</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for 2013, we can map the differences in </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">mortgage interest</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/public_map"><span style="font-weight:400;">real estate taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> reported on taxpayer returns. The amounts shown in the map below are an average of the deduction amounts reported by zip code, showing the relative benefit of these deduction to individual taxpayers inside and outside the City of Syracuse.</span></p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/1496309a-3d3d-11e6-b795-0e5db1731f59/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>With the exception of a small area in Downtown Syracuse, we can see that the deeper blue colors (representing larger benefits) are almost totally in outlying suburban areas &#8211; this subsidy effect is even starker for real estate taxes.</p>
<div class="embed-cartodb"><iframe width='100%' height='520px' frameborder='0' src='https://markh.cartodb.com/viz/f1c7a7d7-4d19-408a-b4f8-c7ce5b818cb3/embed_map' allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the urban <strong>13205</strong> zip code the average mortgage interest reported on individual returns was about $3,500 and the average real estate taxes reported was about $3,100. In contrast, the <strong>13104</strong> zip code in the Eastern part of the county saw an average mortgage interest of over $7,000 and the average real estate taxes reported over $10,000. These amounts were even higher in the <strong>13152</strong> zip code in the far western part of the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The small area in Downtown Syracuse that saw higher average mortgage interest and real estate taxes reported than the rest of the city likely reflects some recent redevelopment efforts, particularly in the Armory Square area. The overall impact of these tax benefits inside the city is quite low though &#8211; the number of returns in this zip code number only a few hundred, while the number of returns reporting these deductible amounts in the suburbs numbered in the thousands,.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These federal and state tax policies act as a sort of hidden government subsidy for suburban homeowners, deepening the impact of zoning decisions that get made by a maze of local boards and officials. Taken together, the combined impact of these varied policy decisions that get made at different levels of government is to institutionalize a system that encourages higher income homeowners to leave the City of Syracuse and forces lower income homeowners (or would be homeowners) to remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The disorganized nature of these various decisions does give us some wiggle room &#8211; there’s enough space for deniability, to convince ourselves that this is just a “city problem.” But the increasingly concentrated level of poverty we see in Syracuse is not accidental. It is the result of deliberate policy decisions that touch every homeowner in our region &#8211; whether we live in the City of Syracuse or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Everyone&#8217;s hands are a little dirty &#8211; there&#8217;s no smoking gun like with redlining in the 1930&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s but a fog of uneven outcomes and easy excuses hangs over our entire community.</span></p>
<p>We are all complicit in this outcome. And we all have a stake in fixing it.</p>
<p><b>Fixing our Broken Community</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Reversing the level of concentrated poverty in the City of Syracuse is a key to our region’s growth and long-term prosperity. There simply aren&#8217;t any examples of areas in our country with growing economies and populations that have an urban core with the as many problems as ours does. We can&#8217;t hide out in the peace of the suburbs any more and pretend the problems aren&#8217;t ours. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s hard to imagine a realistic plan for economic and community growth that doesn’t address our area’s problems with poverty. And since the factors that created this problem are the result of policy decisions made largely outside of the city, it’s hard to overstate how important it is for real leadership on this issue by county, state and federal officials &#8211; not just for Syracuse, but for other Upstate cities as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fixing this problem will take time, but there are some things we can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">First, let’s hold our county officials accountable when they decide to </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/business-news/index.ssf/2015/09/tax_breaks_approved_for_luxury_apartment_homes_in_lysander.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">subsidize luxury housing in the suburbs</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is just terrible public policy given the current level of poverty concentration in our region’s urban core, and underscores just how rudderless our county’s land use decision making is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Let’s use the </span><a href="https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/"><span style="font-weight:400;">local dialog happening</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> around the Consensus Commission plan to advocate for centralized land use planning and an enforceable land use plan for Onondaga County. Of all of the many opportunities for consolidation identified in the Consensus Commission plan, this is the one with the biggest potential benefit for our community. If we failed to pursue every other consolidation opportunity but this one, our region could still see enormous benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finally, let’s insist to our state and federal elected officials that any economic development or growth plan they support should include &#8211; as a central component &#8211; addressing concentrated poverty in Upstate cities. This problem is not Syracuse’s alone and it’s hard to imagine an economic  growth plan for the Upstate region being in any way effective if it ignores the fact that we have large portions of our urban populations trapped in poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our current County Executive grew up in the City of Syracuse and the New York State Senate Deputy Majority Leader is a lifelong Syracuse resident. The work of the Consensus Commission has been sanctioned and supported by the Governor, and has largely been received well in our community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We seem to have the requisite political clout to begin addressing the problem of concentrated poverty in Syracuse in a real and lasting way. </span></p>
<p>Let’s not miss the chance.</p>

<p>Getting a speeding ticket in the State of New York can be a traumatic &#8211; and expensive &#8211; experience.</p>
<p>Drivers convicted of speeding often face <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ny-new-york/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php">penalties and fines</a>, and repeated or excessive offenses can result in the loss of a license. But in some places in New York State, drivers issued a speeding ticket may see a very different outcome than one would typically expect: a smaller fine, the avoidance of long-term penalties, and &#8211; oddly enough &#8211; additional money in local government coffers.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a post detailing some data science techniques that <a href="https://civic.io/2015/02/03/command-line-data-science/">used a data set from the State of New York</a> on traffic violations. This is an <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">incredibly rich data set</a> and it&#8217;s awesome that the state makes this available as open data. However, the issuance of traffic tickets only tells part of a larger story &#8211; since the release of this initial data set, the state has now released data on <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">traffic ticket convictions</a>. Comparing both of these data sets allows us to see the full picture of what happens when a traffic ticket is issued in the State of New York, from issuance all the way through to adjudication.</p>
<p>An examination of these data sets show that &#8211; in certain areas of the state &#8211; tickets issued for speeding are much more likely to be negotiated down to a lessor offense that allows drivers to avoid a penalty from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and actually provides a backdoor benefit for local governments.</p>
<p><span id="more-4623"></span></p>
<p><strong>A Lesser Offense </strong></p>
<p>There is a longstanding practice in New York State that allows local courts where traffic violations are adjudicated to accept a plea bargain for a lessor offense from some drivers that are issued tickets for speeding. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any hard and fast set of rules governing this behavior, but what I have found through research suggests that at the judge or prosecutor&#8217;s discretion motorists that don&#8217;t have prior speeding violations and/or weren&#8217;t speeding excessively may be allowed to plead down to a non-moving violation. These lessor offenses typically aren&#8217;t reported to DMV so they don&#8217;t result in <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system">points against a driver&#8217;s license</a>. The fines owed for these non-moving violations may be lower than the fines for speeding, and because of the nature of the offense all of the fine revenue goes to the local jurisdiction, not the state.</p>
<p>This would seem to create a perverse incentive for local jurisdictions to allow drivers to plead down speeding tickets, and some proposals have been made to <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20130126/cityandregion/130129321/1010">alter the practice</a>. Funding municipal operations through fines and penalties has led to <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-ferguson-missouri-court-fines-budget.html">serious issues in other parts of the country</a>, and we should be concerned that this practice may result in an uneven (and unfair) application of the law. Whether or not a motorist should be allowed to plead down to a lesser offense should be based on factors other than whether the local jurisdiction wants or needs the revenue to fund their operations.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; thanks to the State of New York&#8217;s open data efforts &#8211; we have data that can be used to determine how widespread this practice is, and make some recommendations for what policy makers should do going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Data</strong></p>
<p>Once the data from the state&#8217;s portal is loaded into a local <acronym title="Relational Database management System">RDBMS</acronym> (more on this in the technical notes below), we can run queries against it. For the purposes of this analysis, we wanted to determine the <em>conviction rate</em> for speeding tickets for each local court in the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">convictions data set</a>. To do this, we need to count up the number of tickets issued for speeding violations that get assigned to each local court and compare it the number of convictions for speeding offenses for that court. In other words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>speeding convictions / speeding tickets issues = conviction rate</strong></p>
<p>In running queries against the data, it probably makes sense to limit our analysis to jurisdictions where a non-trivial number of speeding tickets are issued. If pleading down tickets to lesser offenses creates an unwanted incentive for local officials, this is probably more likely to occur in places the local revenue generated from this practice is more significant.</p>
<p>So, if we restrict our analysis to jurisdictions where 10,000 or more speeding tickets were issued over the four year period covered by the state&#8217;s data, we get the following.</p>

</pre>
<p>At the top of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lowest</span> conviction rates for speeding tickets issued &#8211; we see the City of Tonawanda (not to be confused with the Town of Tonawanda, which is also on the list)  located in Western New York near Buffalo. The rate of conviction on speeding tickets in the City of Tonawanda is about 7.5%. The Town of Hamburg and the Town of Amherst &#8211; which also have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets &#8211; are also in Western NY.</p>
<p>Overall, the list includes areas with major highways and significant traffic levels &#8211; Clarkstown, Yonkers, Suffolk and Southampton are all downstate and Long Island, and Troy and Guilderland are in the Capital Region &#8211; which are places where we would expect to see lots of traffic tickets issued. If we look at how the practice of pleading down traffic violations plays out in terms of local revenue, we can see that it may provide significant support for some jurisdictions. In the <a href="http://www.ci.tonawanda.ny.us/treasurer/budget_2015_and_supporting_documentation.pdf">City of Tanowanda</a>, fine revenue represents about $475,000 annually &#8211; about 6.5% of total city revenue (excluding state aid). Not the largest revenue source by any stretch, but certainly enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the highest rates of convictions for speeding tickets are the various <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/find-tvb-office-locations">Traffic Violation Bureaus</a>. These are run by the state DMV, so there is no incentive to plead down speeding tickets to lesser offenses and generate local revenue. In fact, I don&#8217;t think plea bargains are allowed at these facilities. This means that for some areas &#8211; like Western NY &#8211; drivers may see the final adjudication of their speeding ticket handled very differently depending on where it is issued (or, more accurately, depending on the court it is assigned to).</p>
<p>Around the City of Buffalo there are a number of jurisdictions &#8211; Tonawanda, Amherst, Hamburg, Cheektowanga &#8211; that have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets. But within the City of Buffalo (where speeding tickets are adjudicated by the Traffic Violation Bureau) the conviction rates are much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Go From Here?</strong></p>
<p>The current situation, where drivers issued speeding tickets are allowed to plead down to lesser offenses and generate local revenue, seems far from ideal for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The practice of supporting municipal operations through penalty and fine revenue can create <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/doj-warns-local-courts-in-u-s-about-use-of/article_b9b8afd6-74e1-5303-ae3d-c3492514714e.html">perverse incentives</a> and undermine people&#8217;s confidence in the impartiality of government officials. Because there are no hard and fast rules governing how different jurisdictions allow drivers to plead to lesser offenses, there is no way to make sure that this opportunity is being evenly applied. Do men and women plead at the same rate? Do minorities plead at the same rate as whites? The data currently available don&#8217;t allow us to evaluate these questions, but the quasi-formal nature of the practice should raise concerns.</p>
<p>Moreover, the incentive created by this practice should be particularly concerning from a traffic safety perspective. The penalties and fines established for speeding are put in place for a reason &#8211; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.21798/abstract">they work</a>, by reducing the incidence of fatal accidents and loss of life. Permitting speeders a chance to plea to a lesser offense allows potentially dangerous drivers to remain on the road with little consequence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all state policy makers see it this way. In Buffalo &#8211; where this analysis shows the imbalance between conviction rates is stark &#8211; state legislators have in recent years <a href="http://wivb.com/2014/06/20/coming-soon-to-buffalo-talking-down-traffic-tickets/">moved to allow speeders in the city to plead to a lesser offense</a>, the same opportunity afforded ticketed drivers in surrounding towns and villages.</p>
<p>This is a move in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Local governments &#8211; particularly in Upstate New York &#8211; are strapped financially, burdened by crumbling infrastructure and face a host of challenges in funding their operations. But we should not allow the practice of pleading down speeding tickets to be used as a way to provide a financial crutch to New York&#8217;s ailing local governments. Policy makers should eliminate this practice altogether.</p>
<p>Supporting local governments shouldn&#8217;t require making our highways and roadways less safe.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Notes: Here&#8217;s How I Obtained and Used the Data</strong></p>
<p>The logic for calculating conviction rates is contained in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-rate-sql">couple of stored procedures</a> &#8211; one to determine the conviction rate for speeding tickets for a given year, and the other to calculate it over the four year period that both data sets cover (this is the one used to generate the table shown above). This is obviously not to most elegant or efficient SQL, but for the purposes of this analysis it will do the job.</p>
<p>All of the data used in this analysis is available from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">State of New York&#8217;s open data portal</a> and cover the period from 2011 &#8211; 2014. Specifically, I make use of the traffic ticket data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">here</a>, and the traffic ticket conviction data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">here</a>. Since I want to combine data from both sets, I opted to download both and load them into a local RDBMS so I could run <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> queries on them.</p>
<p>The traffic ticket data set is rather large &#8211; over 14 million rows. It contains one record for each ticket issued along with descriptive information about the violation, when it was issued and the court it was assigned to for adjudication. For the purposes of this analysis, we are interested in tickets issued for speeding, so we confine our queries to a subset of all tickets with the set of descriptions <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-violation-descriptions-md">listed here</a>. This list was generated by selecting violation descriptions with the word <code>SPEED</code> in them &#8211; a little simplistic but not a bad way to start. A few of the ticket categories seem out of place &#8211; like <code>UNLAWFUL SPEEDOMETER</code> and <code>VEH WITH PERFORMANCE SPEED LESS THAN 55 MPH REG-9</code> &#8211; so for now, we&#8217;ll drop them from our analysis.</p>
<p>The conviction data set contains aggregate counts of convictions for specific violation types (in this analysis, I focused on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-descriptions-md">this set</a>). Since these are aggregate counts, we can&#8217;t tie specific tickets to an outcome in a local court (at least not with these data sets). However, we can look at each court and sum up the types of convictions that occur for a given time period. Since the ticket data set includes information on the court each ticket was assigned to, we can create a view of how many tickets issued for speeding in the State of New York were plead down to lesser offenses and in which jurisdictions the practice is more prevalent.</p>
<p>I should note that the conviction data set needed a bit of tweaking before I could conduct this analysis. The format for the <code>Court_Name</code> field was slightly different from the ticket data set, and this was the field I wanted to use to match ticket counts to conviction counts. Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, I was able to modify this data set and add a new column named <code>Standard_Court_Name</code> that used the same naming convention as the ticket data set. As such, the table structure for this data set in my local database <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-data-load-sql">differs slightly</a> from the structure of the data available on the NYS data portal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to deriving useful results about the operation of government from open data sets, we have an enormous array of tools at our disposal that we can make use of. Often, we do not need sophisticated or expensive tools to produce useful results.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to use command line tools that are available on most laptops, and others that can be downloaded for free, to derive meaningful insights from a real government open data set. The following examples will leverage *nix-based tools like <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_%28Unix%29">tail</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(Unix)">sort</a></code>, <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq">uniq</a></code> and <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a></code> as well as open source tools that can be invoked from the command line like <code><a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.0/">csvkit</a></code> and <code><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a></code>.</p>
<p>The data used in this post is from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Beginning-2008/q4hy-kbtf">NY State Open Data Portal</a> for traffic tickets issued in New York State from 2008 &#8211; 2012.</p>
<p><span id="more-3686"></span></p>
<p>I chose to download select portions of the data to my laptop in part so that I could play around with command line utilities, but also because I found the tools and options available on the data portal a bit clunky and difficult to use. This dataset is fairly large &#8211; around 18M rows &#8211; and manipulating it on the portal often seemed to take a long time (not really sure why). In addition, I felt like the data itself was so useful and compelling, I didn&#8217;t really need anything more than what I already had available to me in <a href="https://civic.io/2014/01/15/5-essential-open-data-tools/">my own data toolkit</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve packaged up all of the data used in the following examples and saved them to a public Dropbox folder &#8211; you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l0xs6wo198npzy3/AACr5iXK5k8lHlarqPJZiVGWa?dl=0">get the data files here</a>, or simply download them directly from the NY Open Data Portal. (Note &#8211; the structure of the samples files in the Dropbox folder differs slightly from those that can be downloaded from the portal. For convenience, I separated records for specific years into separate files and removed the column titled <em>Violation Year</em>.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, if you decide to follow these examples you should read the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/api/views/q4hy-kbtf/files/qG3-cahBhdYsuQlMN8KrOrqEq_110cUjrUf4mt35TPM?download=true&amp;filename=NYSDMV_OpenData_Tickets_DataDictionary.pdf">metadata</a> and make sure you <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Beginning-2008/q4hy-kbtf/about">understand the limitations of the data</a>. Not all tickets &#8211; specifically for some violations in NYC &#8211; are included in this data set. Once we understand what the data includes, we can start to ask (and hopefully answer) some interesting questions.</p>
<p><strong>Q1: Are Men Better Drivers Than Women?</strong></p>
<p>There is a long held stereotype that men are better drivers than women.</p>
<p>The data on traffic tickets can help us to find out if there is any factual basis for such a claim, and once we have the data in hand we can use simple command line tools to start to work with it.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s count up the number of traffic tickets issued in NY State in 2012. To do this, we&#8217;ll use <code>tail</code> and <code>wc</code>.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012.csv | wc -l
 3524692
</pre>
<p>By using the <strong>+2</strong> with <code>tail</code>, we&#8217;re telling it to output the contents of the entire file starting on the second line in the file (to avoid counting the header row). We then pipe the output into <code>wc</code> and use the <strong>-l</strong> flag to indicate that we want to count the number of lines. Since each line in the file represents a ticket issued, we can see that there were more than 3.5 million tickets issued in NY State in 2012.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s repeat the process for 2011.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2011.csv | wc -l
 3643061
</pre>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that there were slightly fewer tickets issued in 2012 than in 2011 across the entire state (about 3.2% fewer in 2012).</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s count up the number of tickets issued based on the gender of the person ticketed. To do this, we&#8217;ll add some additional tools. We&#8217;ll use <code>csvcut</code> to separate out the 7th column in each line outputted by tail (which holds the value for gender), and then we&#8217;ll use <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> to total the number of unique values. When we use the <strong>-c</strong> flag with <code>uniq</code> it will tally up the counts for each unique value that we pipe to it.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012 | csvcut -c 7 | sort | uniq -c

17090 C
962450 F
2542324 M
2828 U
</pre>
<p>In this case, we can see that in addition to a value of <strong>M</strong> for males and <strong>F</strong> for females we have <strong>C</strong> and <strong>U</strong>. According to the <a href="///Users/mheadd/Downloads/NYSDMV_OpenData_Tickets_DataDictionary%20(1).pdf">data dictionary</a> from the NY Open Data Portal, a value of <strong>C </strong>indicates that the ticketed entity was an organization and a <strong>U</strong> indicates that the gender was unknown or not collected. Even if we assumed that all of the <strong>C</strong> and <strong>U</strong> rows were attributable to female drivers (which the most likely aren&#8217;t) we can see that the number of tickets issued to male drivers far outpaced females in 2012.</p>
<p>According to the NY State DMV, in 2012 female drivers accounted for <a href="http://dmv.ny.gov/statistic/2012lic.pdf"> about 49 percent of all licensed drivers</a> in the state. Our results show that female drivers accounted for only about 27% of all tickets issued in 2012, while men accounted for a whopping 73% during the same time period.</p>
<p>One issue with our data that we may want to correct before finalizing this observation is that it includes non-NY State drivers. We know what the proportion of men and women drivers is in NY State, but not for the population that received tickets in NY State in 2012 (which includes drivers from a large number of different states and territories). To find out how many of those drivers ticketed in 2012 were licensed in NY State, we need to introduce a new tool &#8211; <code>grep</code>.</p>
<pre>$ tail +2 violations2012.csv | csvcut -c 6 | grep -c "NEW YORK"

2902325
</pre>
<p>By following our previous example and using <code>csvcut</code> to extract the appropriate column (the one containing the state in which the driver is licensed), we can specify that we only want to count those rows where the value is equal to &#8220;NEW YORK&#8221;. We do this using the <strong>-c</strong> flag of <code>grep</code>, which works much like the one we used for <code>uniq</code> above.</p>
<p>Now we can combine both approaches and count up the number of tickets issued by the gender of the ticket recipient for drivers licensed in NY State.</p>
<pre>~$ tail +2 violations2012.csv \
&gt; | csvcut -c 6,7 \
&gt; | grep "NEW YORK" \
&gt; | csvcut -c 2 \
&gt; | sort \
&gt; | uniq -c

 620 C
829695 F
2070547 M
1463 U
</pre>
<p>Note that we use <code>csvcut</code> twice in this example. We first use it to extract the columns that contain the gender of the recipient and the state in which they are licensed (we do this by using the <strong>-c</strong> flag and indicating the two columns we are interested in). We then pipe the output of that operation to <code>grep</code> to select only those that have &#8220;NEW YORK&#8221; and then again pass it to <code>csvcut</code> to single out the column holding the value for gender.</p>
<p>Our results don&#8217;t change all that much, and we can conclude with some confidence &#8211; if getting ticketed for a traffic violation is a good proxy for driving skill &#8211; that women are much better drivers than men.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to delve deeper into this data.</p>
<p><strong>Q2: Which Police Agencies Issue the Most Tickets?</strong></p>
<p>To find out which police agencies issue the most tickets &#8211; and, maybe more interestingly, how the number of tickets issued changed from 2011 to 2012 &#8211; we&#8217;ll introduce a relational database to the mix</p>
<p>For the following examples I&#8217;ll use MySQL and a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/b1eb45ab74cccd05abf8">very simple import script</a> to bring the data from the CSV files we have been working with into a database. But you can use any database tool that you want to do something similar. If you don&#8217;t have MySQL installed, you can download it <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">here</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s create the MySQL database and import our CSV files.</p>
<pre>~$ mysql -u username &lt; path/to/violations.sql
</pre>
<p>Next, we log into the MySQL CLI and start using the new <code>violations</code> database that we just created.</p>
<pre>~$ mysql -u username
mysql&gt; use violations;
</pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s sum up the number of tickets issued by police agency in 2012 for the top 10 agencies.</p>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT Police_Agency AS 'Agency', SUM(1) AS 'Number' FROM _2012 
    -&gt; GROUP BY Police_Agency 
    -&gt; ORDER BY Number DESC 
    -&gt; LIMIT 10;
+----------------------------+---------+
| Agency                     | Number  |
+----------------------------+---------+
| NYC PD                     | 1041037 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  PD      |  177551 |
| COUNTY OF NASSAU  PD       |  148919 |
| CITY OF ROCHESTER PD       |   33765 |
| FARMINGDALE STATE POLICE   |   32842 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  SHERIFF |   31972 |
| MIDDLETOWN STATE POLICE    |   31563 |
| COUNTY OF MONROE SHERIFF   |   30799 |
| ROCHESTER STATE POLICE     |   30354 |
| CITY OF SYRACUSE PD        |   30247 |
+----------------------------+---------+
10 rows in set (3.00 sec)
</pre>
<p>These results aren&#8217;t all that surprising &#8211; in terms of raw numbers, we would expect to see the NYC police, larger downstate counties and the big cities upstate in the top 10 list. We can also do the same thing for 2011.</p>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT Police_Agency AS 'Agency', SUM(1) AS 'Number' FROM _2011 
    -&gt; GROUP BY Police_Agency 
    -&gt; ORDER BY Number DESC 
    -&gt; LIMIT 10;
+-------------------------------+---------+
| Agency                        | Number  |
+-------------------------------+---------+
| NYC PD                        | 1060588 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  PD         |  161276 |
| COUNTY OF NASSAU  PD          |  146046 |
| CITY OF ROCHESTER PD          |   34443 |
| MIDDLETOWN STATE POLICE       |   33702 |
| CITY OF SYRACUSE PD           |   33415 |
| TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE TUNNEL AUTH |   32214 |
| COUNTY OF SUFFOLK  SHERIFF    |   31788 |
| FARMINGDALE STATE POLICE      |   31187 |
| COUNTY OF MONROE SHERIFF      |   30386 |
+-------------------------------+---------+
10 rows in set (3.19 sec)
</pre>
<p>Interesting to note that the City of Syracuse PD has seen pretty dramatic drop off in tickets from 2011 to 2012 (a drop of almost 10 percent). But what I really want to do is to look at all police agencies and compare 2012 to the previous year to see how the number of tickets issued has changed for each.</p>
<p>The most convenient tool to make this kind of comparison and to sort results would probably be a spreadsheet (Excel or Google Docs). To import into either of those, we&#8217;ll need a CSV file with the total number of tickets issued by each police agency for both years.</p>
<p>To generate this CSV file, we can leverage MySQL by passing in a simple SQL query to the MySQL CLI and then use the <code>sed</code> tool to filter the results. Specifically, when the MySQL CLI outputs the results they will be tab delimited. We want to replace the tabs with commas and then direct the results to an output file. We use the following command to generate the results for 2012.</p>
<pre>echo "use violations; select Police_Agency as 'Agency', SUM(1) as '2012 Number' from _2012 group by Agency;" \
| mysql -u username \
| sed 's/	/,/g' \
&gt; agency_counts_1.csv
</pre>
<p>And we repeat the process for 2011 results.</p>
<pre>echo "use violations; select Police_Agency as 'Agency', SUM(1) as '2011 Number' from _2011 group by Agency;" \
| mysql -u username \
| sed 's/	/,/g' \
&gt; agency_counts_2.csv
</pre>
<p>Next we&#8217;ll use <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripts/csvjoin.html"><code>csvjoin</code></a> to combine the files and match up the rows holding results for police agencies from 2012 and 2011 into a file called <code>agency_counts.csv</code>.</p>
<pre>csvjoin -c "Agency,Agency" agency_counts_1.csv agency_counts_2.csv &gt; agency_counts.csv
</pre>
<p>We can now open this file in Excel or Google Docs and refine it a bit.</p>
<p>When we joined the two CSV files above, it created a superfluous column called <strong>Agency</strong> &#8211; we can remove this column, calculate the difference in tickets issued between years, sort them and we get results that <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5l4cCrasb73D91cqxP3_6zvwUWDWnoFvgdfwEvl3XA/edit#gid=556461661">look like this</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreting the Results</strong></p>
<p>By sorting this spreadsheet on the <em># Difference</em> column we can see some interesting things. Overall, tickets issued in NY State went down in 2012 over 2011, but for some police agencies the number of tickets issued went up dramatically. In Western New York, both of the Buffalo area police agencies saw dramatic increases in the number of tickets issued. On the eastern side of the state, the Albany PD saw a dramatic increase in tickets, and Downstate the suffolk County PD saw a healthy increase.</p>
<p>What caused these results? Was there something significant in the type of traffic violations issued by these agencies? Was there something important about the time of year (or the time of day) that they were issued? To find out, we&#8217;ll need to do more analysis, which is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
<p>What I hoped to show is that some of the most powerful data tools are widely available, easy to use command line utilities. When it comes to deriving useful results about the operation of government from data sets, we have an enormous array of tools at our disposal to use. Often, we do not need sophisticated or expensive tools to produce useful results.</p>
<p>We just need good data.</p>
