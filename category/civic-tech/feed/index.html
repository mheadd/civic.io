<p class="graf graf--p">Famed management consultant Peter Drucker is often credited with the phrase “culture eats process (or strategy) for breakfast.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">You can’t change organizations by implementing new processes alone, so the thinking goes, you have to foster a new culture in order to drive real change. To understand the degree to which this idea is accepted as management philosophy gospel, we have but to count the number of times it is repeated at conferences, in meetings, or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/_jfeldman/status/1222660625794584576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a> by various thought leaders.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But when we think about changing the way public sector organizations work, particularly in how they acquire and manage new technology, this idea gets flipped. In the world of government technology, process eats culture for breakfast.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">One of the great truisms that underlies much of the work being done by digital service teams in governments around the world, and in civic tech communities, is that governments are not very good at adopting or managing new technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of general disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly — technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">People working in and around government digital transformation often take the position that the disfunction they see in public sector technology adoption is the result of a lack of knowledge or awareness on how to do something “the right way.” As a result, a great deal of energy and effort is expended telling governments how to do things differently when it comes to technology adoption. We often seek to develop a new culture in government organizations — one that values the input of users, embraces smaller projects and more speedy deployment, and highlights the value of cross functional teams.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">But what if we proceeded from the assumption that there are people in government who generally know that they need to change the way they do things, but are unable to do so. Framed this way, the challenge for those of us working in government digital transformation becomes less about telling people <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what </em>to do, and more about understanding the barriers keeping them from doing things differently.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The challenges facing governments as it relates to technology adoption are quite specific — there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. More importantly, each of these processes that hinder efficient technology adoption work <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">as designed</em>. They are not broken. They exist for a reason.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these processes are, and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically. If we don’t these process will end up eating the new culture we hope to bring to government organizations, and the problems we hope to solve will go on.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile development are all cultural changes that digital service teams try to bring to their partners in government agencies. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/03/13/win-big-by-going-small/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Each underscores the value of “smallness”</a> — breaking work down into smaller pieces and delivering them more quickly. This reduces risk, and helps us ensure we are delivering services that will address real user needs. There is also ample data showing that larger technology projects <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/BigBangBoom.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fail at a much higher rate than smaller ones</a>.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">It’s no secret that reduced project sizes and more rapid delivery to users improves project success rates, but why is it still so common to see large technology projects with long delivery timelines in government?</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Let’s think about the processes that impact how a government technology project gets funded, approved, and implemented. these includes things like the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/federal-budget-process.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">budget process</a>, intergovernmental <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding and governance processes</a>, and the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://atos.open-control.org/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accreditation process</a> for software applications.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Federal and state budget processes begin many months before a single dollar ever gets spent. As much as 18 months before a budget is even enacted, the executive branch will transmit instructions to agencies for preparing the future budget request. This will include a complex set of documents that will capture the amount of funding that agencies will request , as well as a detailed justification for why they need it.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies will need these detailed justifications as the embark on a months-long set of hearings where their requests are questioned and scrutinized over and over again, first by the executive budget office and then later by legislative committees. Digital service teams often engage with agency partners after a budget has already been enacted, and the agency is ready to spend the money that has been approved. It’s not uncommon for these teams to find the agency’s plans for spending approved funds to be overly detailed and prescriptive, suffering from all of the symptoms of the Big Requirements Up Front (BRUF) approach.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">The success of a digital service teams’ efforts in working with an agency partner like this typically depends on whether they can instill the culture of “smallness,” by adopting approaches like modular contracting, DevOps, and Agile. Unwinding these plans for overly large technology projects, which fail more often than smaller ones, is not always successful. What’s often missed is that the budget process that makes funding for these projects available doesn’t just allow large projects to happen, it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">incentivizes</em> them. It makes larger projects more likely than smaller ones.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Agencies that can describe in detail to executive branch officials and legislators exactly how they will spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 18–24 months in advance are the ones that get their projects funded. BRUF is a virtue in the process in which budgets get formulated and adopted. It’s a process tailor made to encourage a waterfall approach to projects.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">There are similar effects from other processes central to how technology projects get funded and approved. The process that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocse/apd_guide_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governs how states receive funding for systems to administer federal programs</a> (e.g., Medicaid) have similar waterfall- inducing features. When these processes require states to develop large, detailed plans up front for funding approval, and impose burdensome gated reviews checkpoints during project execution, it makes larger (and more complex, and riskier) projects <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">more</em> likely.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This is also true of the processes whereby software applications are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2017/volume-2/navigating-the-us-federal-government-agency-ato-process-for-it-security-professionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accredited and granted approval to operate</a> — a key milestone in many government technology projects. In some federal agencies, this process can take many months, or even years. The process usually requires many steps, lots of manual work and is paperwork-intensive.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because agencies face these burdensome processes at key approval points in a technology project’s lifecycle, it’s not hard to understand why larger projects are more common. From the perspective of the agencies that must comply with gated reviews and ATOs, it’s rational to decide on a project approach that minimizes exposure to these processes. If iterative delivery of smaller project components requires an agency to navigate these labor and time intensive processes more frequently, it helps us understand more clearly why larger projects are more common.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">In the early days of government digital service teams, the goal was to bring a new culture to government — one that approached risk differently, and placed the needs of users at the center of the work. A decade or so into this work it, seems more obvious than ever that simply bringing a new culture to government technology projects won’t be enough.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Simply telling agencies what they need to do misses the influence of existing processes — all working exactly as designed — on technology project outcomes. The need to reform these fundamental processes underscores that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://peknet.com/2020/02/15/digital-service-is-not-about-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our most important work is not about technology</a>.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Either we work on fixing these processes, or they will continue to eat our agile culture for breakfast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>
<p><span id="more-4767"></span></p>
<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4773" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=1000" alt="Hendricks Chapel" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=1000 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /><p id="caption-attachment-4773" class="wp-caption-text">Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University</p></div>
<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>

<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=1000" alt="should"   /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p>The term “civic tech” gets used a lot, and it often means different things to different people. To me, this has always meant that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly &#8211; all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will ultimately be broad and durable. I’ve never been prone to excessive handwringing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I believe very firmly that the most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all. Real people &#8211; with empathy and a desire to make their community better &#8211; are the most important kind of civic technology. A recently released report on civic technology by Omidyar Network entitled </span><a href="http://enginesofchange.omidyar.com/docs/OmidyarEnginesOfChange.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">Engines of Change</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> underscores this idea, and helps emphasize that the connections between people &#8211; both inside the civic tech community and outside it &#8211; are what&#8217;s most important to its future growth.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4676"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The report presents a blueprint of sorts for how those working in and supporting civic tech can help it grow in a way that deepens its impact and broadens its appeal. It very smartly highlights a set of opportunities for the different groups working in the civic tech ecosystem that each can follow to help civic tech grow. I think that those of us working in this sector should embrace these recommendations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our findings show a critical link between cities and practitioners. Civic tech is not a sector that has been driven forward entirely outside of governmental systems. Rather, it has been built in partnership with key stakeholders inside and outside government&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most impactful of these recommendations for me are those directed toward governments and people working inside cities. The report urges these people to reach out to, engage with, and help grow the civic tech community. Having recently moved from a large city with an active and growing civic tech community, to a smaller city with no tradition of civic hacking and little organized engagement around data or technology, I can say emphatically that there seems to be an acute need here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Connecting with innovators outside government and helping to nurture external communities often falls outside the job description (and the skill set) of most public servants &#8211; even those tasked with running open data or innovation programs. Shoehorning these efforts into a traditional government IT department can </span><a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Philadelphias-IT-Reorganization-Receives-Barbs-and-Praise.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">shackle them to a bureaucratic infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that often has little interest or expertise in outward engagement. Placing them in other parts of the organization may help with external focus but may also erode proximity to the part of the organization where important decisions about data and technology are made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding the right approach to enable government employees to interact with and nurture external civic tech communities can be </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">a tough balance to strike</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This can be particularly true in smaller municipalities with nascent open data and innovation programs, and smaller or more dispersed tech communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over the last few years we’ve seen a growth in the number of resources and tools available to municipal governments and civil servants to </span><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/@centerforgov"><span style="font-weight:400;">open up their data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, enact </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/"><span style="font-weight:400;">policies around innovation and technology</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and to make better use of their data themselves. But there seems to be a noticeable lack of practical resources available to assist government officials with identifying and connecting with people outside of government in the civic tech community. Civic tech can’t flourish unless we educate and support municipal officials in their outreach to these groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s why I’m working on creating </span><a href="https://civic.io/2016/06/21/meeting-in-the-middle/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a new guidebook for local government officials</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, building on my own experience in city government and the expertise of a host of others currently working in cities. This process will be open and collaborative, and the results will be released under a Creative Commons license for any government official to use. I hope this will help those in government embrace the opportunity highlighted in the Omidyar report &#8211; to “engage deeply with local civic tech communities.”</span></p>
<p>Municipal governments and other public sector officials need better tools, broader networks, and more information for building (and sustaining) relationships with outside innovators in civic tech. Building out these resources will help ensure that civic tech becomes what we all hope it can &#8211; and what cities and communities need it to become.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A powerful and enduring force for positive change.</span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Open-Data-APIs-Collecting-and-Consuming-What-Cities-Produce.html">an interesting piece</a> on open data APIs on GovTech that echos <a href="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/">a lot</a> of <a href="https://civic.io/2014/08/11/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-government-apis/">the</a> <a href="https://civic.io/2012/02/23/get-opengovernmentapis/">things</a> I&#8217;ve thought and said about government APIs over the past few years. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>APIs are an increasingly important way that governments make their open data available to outside users. Typically, when we talk about open data APIs (and I am as guilty of this as anyone) its almost always with a focus on either the technical underpinnings and data on one side, or the benefits that citizens will ultimately reap from the data being made available on the other.</p>
<p>There are far too seldom discussions of what lies in the middle of these two ends and how this critical piece ultimately helps make government open data APIs better and citizens better off.</p>
<p><span id="more-4666"></span></p>
<p>As powerful and important as APIs are to making open data available and improving how governments operate, the vast majority of citizens will never consume an API directly from a government data publisher. Most won&#8217;t know or care that data or a service they are using is built on data from a government API. Instead, they will most likely consume a finished product, app or service (or read a new story) that is built on data from an API or some other open data source.</p>
<p>What lies in the middle &#8211; between government APIs and citizens end users &#8211; is an important group of intermediaries (or <a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/717715634226860033">infomediaries</a>). This group is made up of private technology companies, entrepreneurs, volunteer civic hackers, journalists, activists, storytellers and others. It&#8217;s an important group for governments to reach out to, engage with and nurture. Far too seldom in our discussions about how to build great open data APIs do we discuss the strategies and skills needed to do these things.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, and to give people inside government some strategies for engaging with outside data intermediaries, I&#8217;m working on a new guidebook that I hope to make available in the next few months.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This guidebook will be designed to help civil servants find and collaborate with people doing innovative and valuable work outside government, particularly those working with technology and data. It will list specific strategies that can be employed by those working in the bureaucracy to help them leverage the talents of smart, passionate people outside government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to this guidebook, or want to get a peek at an early draft, <a href="mailto:mheadd@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The term “civic technology” gets used a lot, and it may mean different things to different people. I think this highlights the fact that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly — all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will be broad and durable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For me, the term civic technology is inextricably related to the world of </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/11/06/the-collaborative-state/"><span style="font-weight:400;">civic hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. I began my career in government in what I would describe as the “old fashioned way”: graduate school to study public administration followed by work on political campaigns. Having now worked for three different state and local governments in both the legislative and executive branches, I consider civic hacking and civic technology to be the future of how governments will deliver services.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4654"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Distilled to its essence, civic hacking is the existence of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place, and a desire to effect change on that condition. That’s it. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems. Apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a way, civic hacking is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of </span><a href="http://www.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces for interactions with their government. Outside parties have begun developing solutions on top of government-provided or maintained data, often to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, in cities like </span><a href="http://livinglotsnyc.org/#11/40.7300/-73.9900"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the repurposing of vacant properties, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to specific government agencies. These outside efforts are enabled by the </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=property"><span style="font-weight:400;">deliberate release of property information</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by the cities like Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change the way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and, in many ways, an enormous opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This, to me, is the essence of civic technology. Civic tech provides solutions to help governments deliver services to citizens more efficiently. We might think of civic apps as a kind of “last mile” technology — the link between the traditional infrastructure of government technology and the tools people ultimately use to interact with and get information from government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important component of civic technology is that it requires active collaboration between people inside government, including elected officials and government employees, and those outside government, the people in the neighborhoods and communities being served by government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The old way of delivering government services is over. Civic technology — technology we build together — is the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In early 2012, I had the opportunity to present at the annual South by Southwest Interactive Conference in Austin, TX. The focus of my presentation was the</span><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP100093"><span style="font-weight:400;"> lessons learned from two civic hacking events</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in late 2011 that I had helped organize in Philadelphia and Baltimore.</span></p>
<p>This was an exciting time for me professionally. After leaving government to become a professional software developer and technology evangelist in the early 2000s, I had been drawn back into the world of government a few years prior through the open data movement. By 2011, I was working regularly with budding civic tech communities in two different but geographically close cities. I was able to collaborate with groups of people who cared deeply about the future of their cities and who were committed to making a difference.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was also an exciting time for civic tech—Code for America was launching its </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Brigade</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> network at the 2012 SXSWi conference and while there I had a chance to meet and talk with Jen Pahlka, Tim O&#8217;Reilly, and </span><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/kevin-curry"><span style="font-weight:400;">Kevin Curry</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (who went on to build out the Code for America Brigade program and scale it nationally). I was so moved by Jen’s vision for civic tech that I ended up leaving my job with a telecommunications startup and joined Code for America myself a few short weeks after SXSWi ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thinking back on this time, it strikes me that the experience of the two cities I got to talk about then can tell us a lot about what it takes to build and grow a civic tech community. I think it’s exciting that there are places where leaders have essentially </span><a href="http://civichall.org/civicist/toward-sustainability-for-local-tech-organizing/"><span style="font-weight:400;">figured out how to nurture and sustain civic tech</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would argue that there are many places where this issue has not yet been resolved, and even some places where civic tech groups once flourished by have have since </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mheadd/status/717364352500817920"><span style="font-weight:400;">gone dormant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Of interest to me personally, there are also a great many places—particularly small and mid-sized cities—where civic tech organizing has not yet begun.</p>
<p><span id="more-4646"></span></p>
<p><b>Then and Now</b></p>
<p>In many ways, Baltimore and Philadelphia were in similar places from a civic tech perspective in 2011.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The City of Baltimore had just launched an official </span><a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data portal</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and was regularly publishing data to it. A series of small(ish) </span><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/civic-hack-day-in-baltimore-tickets-1271496079"><span style="font-weight:400;">hackathons</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> were organized and there seemed to be a </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/baltimore-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">growing dialogue</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> between the local technology community and city government around data and civic technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At the same time, Philadelphia was in </span><a href="http://www.govfresh.com/2011/12/philadelphia-open-government-2011-year-in-review/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a similar place</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. The city had not yet adopted an open data policy or launched an official open data portal. Philly benefited from being one of the first cities to partner with Code for America and there seemed to be a growing acceptance inside city government for publishing data and generally supporting civic tech. Earlier that year, a local technology company called Azavea built and launched what would become the city’s official open data portal—</span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Open Data Philly</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And yet, if we look at these two cities today they appear to be in very different places with regard to civic tech. Philadelphia has a </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">large and active civic tech community</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> with strong connections to city government—city officials are regular participants in civic tech events, and a recent civic hacking event was kicked off from City Hall </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2016/04/04/demhack-politicians-code-for-philly/"><span style="font-weight:400;">by the Mayor himself</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This community has helped spawn some of the most innovative civic tech solutions in the country, like </span><a href="https://www.councilmatic.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Councilmatic</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—which has since gone on to be adopted in other cities like Chicago and New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore, however, doesn’t have a clearly identifiable civic tech community—though there have been </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Civic-Hacking-Meetup/"><span style="font-weight:400;">efforts to create one</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. There are no regular meetups of people interested in working on civic issues, no regular events to bring the community together and grow it, no regular interactions between city officials and outside civic technologists. This is not because the city lacks passionate, talented people interested in working on civic tech. Far from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Baltimore has not been completely silent on the civic tech front since 2011. There have been a few events—like </span><a href="https://cityparksblog.org/tag/baltimore/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack the Parks</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—that started to build up the relationship between city government and the technology community. These events were largely due to the efforts of people like Andrew Hazlett and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Sharon_Paley"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sharon Paley</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (now with the </span><a href="http://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University). But the organization behind these events—the Greater Baltimore Technology Council—is now </span><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2014/02/24/gbtc-goes-on-hiatus-plans-to.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">defunct</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and no similar organization in Baltimore has moved to fill the role once played by the GBTC in leading civic tech organizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The </span><a href="http://www.digitalharbor.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Digital Harbor Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, under the leadership by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/andrewcoy"><span style="font-weight:400;">Andrew Coy</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—now at the White House, and one of the co-organizers of the civic hacking event in Baltimore I talked about at SXSW in 2012—has developed some pioneering youth technology initiatives in Baltimore. But these efforts seem to operate in a different space from the one we typically expect a civic tech community to occupy. In fact, they seem almost ideally positioned to act as a feeder program for a larger civic tech effort—bringing in young people with passion for their city and arming them with technical skills they can use to make a difference.</span></p>
<p>But that doesn’t seem to be happening largely because of the absence in Baltimore of an organized civic tech community that we typically see in other cities. There isn’t an organized community to feed these youngsters into that’s focused on using technology for the public good in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Both cities have an abundance of factors that I think are critical in helping develop a healthy civic technology community. They both face some pretty significant challenges, have developing startup communities and are full of talented, passionate people that want to work to make their city better. They also both have governments that at least publish some open data and have a formal policy around releasing data.</p>
<p>But beyond simply publishing data, there is at least one factor that is different—the level of involvement by city government in Philadelphia and Baltimore in their respective civic tech communities.</p>
<p><b>The Role of the City</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Writing about his work in supporting </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chi Hack Night</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">—the wildly successful and influential civic hacking meetup in the City of Chicago—</span><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/smartchicago/the-civicwhitaker-anthology-53351581"><span style="font-weight:400;">Christopher Whitaker</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> notes the important role played by city government in building the Chicago ecosystem:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A big part of why we’re able to have as much impact as we do is because we have built a civic innovation ecosystem&#8230;each of these different parts compliments the other. The City of Chicago provides the data that powers the engine. The Chi Hack Night provides a place for talent and collaboration. The Smart Chicago Collaborative provides institutional support.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having city officials engaged and present at civic technology events is a key ingredient to their success, growth and longevity. As a former city official that was present at a lot of civic technology events in Philly my opinion on this issue is not unbiased. But this is a trend that is easy to spot in cities that have active civic tech communities like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/minervatweet/status/512024965294850048"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/messages/boards/thread/48563907"><span style="font-weight:400;">San Francisco</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/05/19/predicting-food-inspection-outcomes-using-open-data.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">Chicago</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/04/04/hackathon-in-boston-7-hubhacks-data-visualization-finalists/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Boston</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and </span><a href="https://codeforphilly.org/people/timwis"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>And if I had to point to one single factor that has stymied the growth of an organized civic tech community in Baltimore—a place with all of the other ingredients necessary for one to flourish—I would point to a lack of active involvement and support from city government.</p>
<p>And if this is right, then I think there are some important lessons here for supporters of civic technology.</p>
<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There are lots of places where the issue of organizing and sustaining civic technology has not yet been resolved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Clearly there are places like Chicago where great strides have been made due to years of investment and institutional support. But there are many other places that have not yet started down the road of civic tech. And as is generally the case with support for open data, these places </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">tend to be small and mid-sized cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that lack institutions like Smart Chicago to support nascent civic tech efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The lessons from Philly and Baltimore also suggest that the progress we have seen in larger cities may be more fragile than we think it is. If direct and enthusiastic support from city government is essential to successfully organizing civic tech efforts, then what happens when that support goes away?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">New York City, under Mayor Bill deBlasio, and Philadelphia, under new Mayor Jim Kenney, suggest that a commitment from city government to open data and engagement with the civic tech community can survive the transition from one administration to the next. But I think it makes sense to consider what happens to civic tech communities when this commitment doesn’t survive that kind of transition, or evaporates for other reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In Madison, Wisconsin, an enthusiastic and growing civic tech community has </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">grown largely stagnant</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> because of a lack of support from city government and hesitancy to release useful data. Derek Eder—one of the organizer of Chi Hack Night in Chicago—in talking about the struggles in the civic tech community in Madison, has said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight:400;">I think the government, especially the city, deserves a lot of credit for helping start the community [in Chicago].</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He’s right, and we shouldn’t forget this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Far from being a resolved issue, civic tech organizing in many places is still in its infancy. Rather than declaring victory, our work should now be focused on institutionalizing things that support civic tech so we can help ensure it survives going forward.</span></p>
