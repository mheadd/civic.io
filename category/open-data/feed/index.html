										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Old tools &amp; new challenges for governments</h2>
<p>There is a common misconception that data-driven decision making and the use of complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a> are a relatively recent phenomenon in the public sector. In fact, making use of (relatively) large data sets and complex algorithms has been fairly common in government for at least the past few decades.</p>
<p>As we begin constructing ethical frameworks for how data and algorithms are used, it is important that we understand how governments have traditionally employed these tools. By doing so, we can more fully understand the challenges governments face when using larger data sets and more sophisticated algorithms and design ethical and governance frameworks accordingly.</p>

<p>In early June 2018, I was on the campus of Syracuse University working on final arrangements for <a href="https://dataupstate.org/summit/">a data conference I was organizing on campus</a>. While there I had a chance to connect with an old classmate, now a professor at the <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/">Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs</a>. We got to talking over coffee about how the school’s traditional programs of study lined up with a lot of the things that were to be discussed at the upcoming conference — open data, big data, predictive analytics and civic hacking.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4773" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4773" data-attachment-id="4773" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/hendricks/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/hendricks.jpeg" data-orig-size="1024,681" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="hendricks" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Hendricks Chapel, on the campus of Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;

<p>There seemed to be some interest in adding new classes to accommodate some of these topics as part of the MPA program, but as we talked he observed that a lot of the things being discussed as part of the civic tech movement seemed very similar to things that had traditionally been taught as part of the typical MPA program. He drew parallels between the use of big data and predictive analysts with disciplines like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics">econometrics</a>, which have long been a part of the public administration toolkit, and have been practiced regularly in government for many decades.</p>
<p>This discussion resonated with me, but I was too distracted with details of the upcoming conference — then just a few days away — to give it deeper thought then. I’ve been meaning to get back to this idea for a while, and with <a href="https://ethicstoolkit.ai/">new frameworks and toolkits</a> for ethical use of data and algorithms being developed, it seems like a good time to unpack this idea a bit more.</p>
<p>Here are the questions that stuck with me from this discussion.</p>
<p>Is the way that governments make use of data and algorithms today fundamentally different than how these tools have traditionally been used? If so, how? And what lessons can we draw from the way governments have traditionally used these tools to guide their use by governments into the future?</p>
<h3>Back in the Day</h3>
<p>A couple of years removed from graduate school, I took a job with the State of Delaware’s Department of Finance and got my first introduction to data-driven decision making. The <a href="https://revenue.delaware.gov/">Division of Revenue</a>, where I worked, was responsible for conducting fiscal analyses of proposed tax law changes, and supporting the work of <a href="https://finance.delaware.gov/publications/DEFAC.shtml">the group that conducted revenue forecasting</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools we used to do our work was a custom software application (developed in house) that calculated the impact of tax law changes. A sprawling, spaghetti code program authored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_FoxPro">FoxPro</a>, the application was a way of calculating tax liability for a set of taxpayers using information from actual tax returns. It allowed us to see how proposed changes to tax rates, deductions, credits, etc. would play out using actual taxpayer data. And while such tools were not uncommon in federal or state tax agencies at the time, Delaware’s small population allowed us to avoid the sampling techniques typically used by other agencies and use real tax information from *every single state taxpayer* in our analyses. It was really quite something — we were stretching the computing resources we had access to at the time (meager as they were) pretty close to their limit.</p>
<p>While I was there, I wrote my first mainframe computer program. It was written in the Natural programming language and queried tax data in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADABAS">ADABAS</a> system. I wrote it to calculate the withholding amounts being reported on individual taxpayer W-2 forms and compared them to the withholding amount being reported by employers when these amounts were remitted to the Division of Revenue. The director of the Division at the time suspected that this might generate some good audit opportunities, and so I was assigned the task of writing the program and delivering the results to the audit unit.</p>
<p>My program added up all of the withholding amounts reported on individual W-2 forms for a particular employer, and then compared the sum to the amounts that the employer had paid the state for that year. If the two numbers were different, it could indicate an underpayment of withholding tax by the employer. It was clunky, and I probably violated lots of Natural programming norms at the time, but it worked.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4774" style="width: 3882px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4774" data-attachment-id="4774" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/dover/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg" data-orig-size="3872,2592" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="dover" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="&lt;p&gt;Delaware State Senate Chamber, Dover DE&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4774" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000" alt="Delaware State Senate Chamber" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1000 1000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=2000 2000w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=768 768w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/dover.jpeg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"   /><p id="caption-attachment-4774" class="wp-caption-text">Delaware State Senate Chamber, Dover DE</p></div>
<p>My memory of these early tools and the work we did in a state tax agency in the late 1990’s informs how I look at the current debate about algorithm use in government. When we ran tax impact analyses to evaluate the impact of proposed tax law changes, our application would tell us how much less (or more) revenue the state would collect based on the change. It could also show the distribution of this change — highlighting which taxpayers would be paying more or less depending on what was changing. It did *not* indicate whether the change was good or bad, positive or negative, just what the change was. Whether the estimated change was desirable was a judgement that others would make (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper#Governor_of_Delaware">Governor’s Office</a> and <a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/">General Assembly</a>), informed by the analysis we provided.</p>
<p>Similarly, my clunky mainframe program provided information on employer withholding payments that was ultimately used by the audit department. The program did some basic sorting, but ultimately the determination of which potential underpayment to pursue first (or most vigorously) was a judgement that others would make. Was it more important to examine the largest potential underpayment, or the most recent? Would employers with lots of employees be examined first, or those that had underpayments in multiple years? These were questions that other state employees in the audit unit would answer using the data that my program generated.</p>
<p>We didn’t conduct a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analyses</a> of our own, but — like other state tax and revenue agencies — we were frequent consumers of econometric reports. These reports helped us to understand broader trends that could potentially impact state revenue collections, and also helped inform larger policy questions. How did the number of years of eduction impact wages? How would a raise in the minimum wage impact employment levels?</p>
<p>Econometric analyses help establish the relationship between different variables — their direction, whether they are causal — and can be used to **quantify** relationships (an x% increase in the minimum wage will result in a y% change in employment). They are, by their nature, predictive. But these analyses don’t infer whether such changes are good or bad, desirable or undesirable: they were inputs into larger policy discussions.</p>
<p>So while the use of algorithms, sophisticated computer programs and other data-driven technology tools in government is not a new phenomenon, their use today is different in some important ways. Understanding the nature of this difference is crucial to understanding why we need ethical frameworks to help guide their use.</p>
<h3>What’s Different Now?</h3>
<p>Changes in computing power and data availability have obviously changed the way we use algorithms and software application in government today. In the 1990’s many state tax agencies used only a sampling of taxpayer data to conduct revenue analyses because of limited access to computers powerful enough (or with large enough hard drives) to analyze every single taxpayer return.</p>
<p>The availability of different tools to build algorithms, and to conduct complex analyses has also mushroomed. Governments have access to many more tools, and at lower cost, than they ever have before to develop new ways to use data. These tools are also increasingly easy to use, and no longer require expertise in application development or mainframe programming to generate outputs.</p>
<p>The availability of these new tools and the abundance of data also means that the use of algorithms and sophisticated software has come out of the policy shop, and is increasingly being used to inform day-to-day government operations. Where previous econometric analyses informed policy debates, and resulted in broad changes affecting large classes of people — often over long periods of time — new algorithmic tools have a much more immediate and direct impact on specific individuals.</p>

<p>In the past, we may have used data to design or fund more effective suicide prevention programs for groups of returning veterans. Today, we use data to <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/includes/viewpdf.cfm?id=2878">identify individual veterans who are demonstrating tendencies</a> deemed to be consistent with suicidal intentions, and direct immediately dispatch intervention resources to their door.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have used data to inform more effective sentencing guidelines to be adopted by state legislatures and eventually impacting how judges passed down sentences. Today, we use data to inform sentencing or pre-trial bail decisions for specific individuals <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/turning-the-granting-of-bail-into-a-science.html?_r=0">on the spot in the courtroom</a>.</p>
<p>Data and algorithms have traditionally been used to inform how policy is created and adopted. Now it is increasingly being used to determine how policy is executed. This immediacy has tremendous appeal, particularly for its potential to improve the efficiency with which government operates. But it also raises a number of ethical concerns.</p>
<p>How can we determine when a potential ethical issue exists in how we use data or algorithms in government? What questions can we ask ourselves before we use these tools to better ensure they are used responsibly and that there is accountability for outcomes?</p>
<h3>Ethical Considerations for Algorithm Use in Government</h3>
<p>Governments making use of data and algorithms face a number of risks in ensuring that these tools are used effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>Data quality is one important risk to consider: is the data accurate and complete? Does the data contain bias or errors that could skew results one way or another? Algorithmic accuracy is another important risk to consider — does the model that is being used produce accurate results?</p>
<p>But it is important to note that these are not new risks. Governments have faced these risks for as long as they have been using data and algorithms. Contemporary algorithm use that is closely tied to policy implementation and execution *does* make these issues more acute, as the potential impact of bad data or algorithmic accuracy is more immediate. But fundamentally, these issues are the same as ones governments have faced for decades.</p>
<p>But there is a new kind of risk that contemporary algorithm use raises that is critical for governments to consider and address as they make use of these new tools. In the past, data and algorithms helped government policy makers understand the relationship between variables — education and wages, tax rates and the distribution of the tax burden. The outputs of these analyses helped inform decisions by policy makers or other actors in government.</p>
<p>Contemporary use of these tools is different in that algorithms now increasingly embody the capacity to make an inference or a judgement about something. In the past, we might have used data to try and identify the relationship between households with specific characteristics and the presence of at risk children to inform policy changes. Today, we use algorithms to identify <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/magazine/can-an-algorithm-tell-when-kids-are-in-danger.html">which specific households government officials think have at risk children in them</a> based on the data fed into a model. The model can infer that the risk of an at-risk child in a household is sufficient to warrant a government agency to take immediate action and intervene.</p>
<p>When we imbue the ability to make a judgement to an algorithm, a new class of ethical questions arises.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4776" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2019/01/16/towards-ethical-algorithms/should/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif" data-orig-size="480,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="should" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=480" class=" size-full wp-image-4776 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/should.gif?w=1000" alt="should"   /></p>
<p>Who do we hold accountable for decisions that get made or actions that are taken by government when some part of the decision making has been ceded to an algorithm? And because the consequences of algorithm use in government are now much more immediate for specific individuals, how do we ensure that their use is being applied fairly and without prejudice or bias?</p>
<p>There are important discussions for current government employees, and those studying to become government administrators to have. It’s heartening to see more and more schools of public administration take up these issues and <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/news/stories/Maxwell_MPA_program_launches_data_analytics_area_of_study,_internship/">give students a grounding in contemporary data and algorithm use</a>.</p>
<p>But as we arm government officials with new tools and training that could potentially revolutionize how we govern and provide public services, we should not lose sight of the ethical issues these new tools create.</p>
<p>We have more work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2014, I had a chance to present on the main stage at the annual </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America Summit</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> in San Francisco. To the surprise of very few people, I was there to talk about cities and data.</span></p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67AXJ_Y1VEA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier that year, I had </span><a href="http://technical.ly/philly/2014/03/20/chief-data-officer-mark-headd-resign-april/"><span style="font-weight:400;">finished up my term</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> as the first Chief Data Officer for the City of Philadelphia, one of the largest cities in the country. But my focus that day was not on big cities like Philadelphia—but rather on smaller cities that had not yet started down the road of leveraging data to spur innovation and inform better policy decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In 2014, the delta between what large cities were doing with data and what small and mid-sized cities were doing </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/09/29/open-data-beyond-the-big-city/"><span style="font-weight:400;">was pretty stark</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4751"></span></p>
<p>Large cities had embraced open data almost universally and had put in place the policy or technology infrastructure necessary to implement open data or data analytics programs. Nineteen of the top 25 most populous cities had an open data portal or a data policy in place at the time. More than 70% of cities with populations over 500,000 had started down the road to leveraging data to make better decisions or change the way they interacted with residents.</p>
<p>In contrast, relatively few smaller cities had begun that work. Of the 256 incorporated places in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000 (based on U.S. Census data), only 39 had adopted a data policy or had implemented an open data portal at that time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But in the time since I gave that talk, much has changed—largely through the work being done as part of the </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">What Works Cities</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> initiative, which was launched by Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2015 to work with mid-sized cities between 100,000 and 1 million in population, and is now partnering with over 75 cities across the country.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Beyond the Big City</span></h2>
<p>Not long after I gave my talk at the Code for America Summit, I moved back to my hometown of Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Like other Upstate cities, Syracuse has its share of </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/syracuses_poverty_rate_remains_among_worst_in_nation_census_finds.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">problems</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/miner_syracuse_water_main_breaks_down_18_percent_but_city_needs_federal_aid.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and seems to live perpetually in the shadow of its gigantic Downstate neighbor—New York City—when it comes to technology and innovation. But the work that Syracuse has done over the past few years to adopt new approaches to sharing and using data are impressive and can serve as a  model not only for other Upstate cities, but for mid-sized cities across the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse has fostered several key strategic relationships that have accelerated its adoption of data-driven innovation. Chief among them is the city’s </span><a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/whatworkscities"><span style="font-weight:400;">participation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in What Works Cities, through which it has been receiving expert technical assistance in the areas of open data and performance analytics from two of the initiative’s partners, the </span><a href="https://govex.jhu.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Center for Government Excellence</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> at Johns Hopkins University and the </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com"><span style="font-weight:400;">Sunlight Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This tops an impressive resume of other partnerships that the city has leveraged to move the needle on data-driven innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The city has also participated in the Bloomberg Philanthropies </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Innovation Teams</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> (or i-teams) program, which fostered the creation of a dedicated group within municipal government to focus on persistent challenges facing the city. One of the first areas of focus for this team was the significant infrastructure issues that have saddled the city for decades. The Syracuse i-team collaborated with the </span><a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Data Science for Social Good</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> project at the University of Chicago to develop a predictive analytic model to help focus limited city resources on the most urgent infrastructure problems. Not only is the city putting the fruits of this partnership to work itself, it is sharing them with other cities using the open source software platform </span><a href="https://github.com/dssg/syracuse_public"><span style="font-weight:400;">Github</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One of the key strategies in Syracuse’s successful adoption of a data and innovation program has been its willingness to import good ideas from other cities and adapt them to its own needs. The city just finished a collaboration with Code for America, which resulted in the development of a </span><a href="https://business.syrgov.net/"><span style="font-weight:400;">new business registration portal </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">that was a top priority of Mayor Stephanie Miner. Because the project leveraged work that had already been done in Long Beach, California, Syracuse could implement a similar solution faster and with less risk than if it had undertaken the work without following a prior example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Earlier this year, Syracuse </span><a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/01/syracuse_fire_department_takes_data-driven_approach_to_getting_smoke_detectors_i.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">unveiled</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> a new program to use data to target at-risk properties in the city for distribution of free smoke detectors from the Syracuse Fire Department. This initiative leveraged a </span><a href="http://labs.enigma.io/smoke-signals/"><span style="font-weight:400;">data model</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> developed originally for the City of New Orleans and that was in use in a number of other cities across the country. By adapting an idea already at work in other cities, Syracuse could piggyback on the hard work that had already been done and bring results to city residents more efficiently.</span></p>
<p>While importing ideas directly from other cities can provide mid-sized cities like Syracuse with a number of advantages, not all ideas translate directly from big cities to smaller ones.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, New York City benefits from the ability to rally its sizable technology community around issues with a civic impact through programs like </span><a href="http://www.bigapps.nyc/"><span style="font-weight:400;">NYC Big Apps</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Other big cities have also used events like this to marshall their private and nonprofit technology communities around issues with citywide impact. But for other cities, with smaller, less centralized technology communities, sponsoring a stand-alone civic technology event can be a daunting challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse’s approach of adapting this big-city idea to work on a smaller stage is a great example for other cities to follow. Instead of hosting its own city-sponsored civic tech events, the city has opted instead to tap into an existing network of technologists in the Central New York region. For the past few years, the city had been quietly interested in a biannual event called </span><a href="http://hackupstate.com/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Hack Upstate</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, held in Downtown Syracuse in the spring and fall of each year. The event consistently attracts a large number of software developers and technologists from across Upstate New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In late 2016, the city partnered with Hack Upstate to unveil a new challenge aimed at analyzing data on road conditions in Syracuse. Participants in Hack Upstate could compete for an additional award as part of the </span><a href="https://cityofsyracuse.github.io/RoadsChallenge/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Syracuse Road Data Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and many participants opted to use the road data that the city made available to participants to </span><a href="https://medium.com/@hackupstate/hack-upstate-viii-the-results-are-in-4c4f4fb1abf#.kn92n0cc3"><span style="font-weight:400;">develop new solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p>
<p>Looking at the work that a city like Syracuse has done over the past few years provides some important lessons for how small and mid-sized cities (and even larger cities) can more fully embrace data as a strategic asset and foster innovation.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Leverage a Network</span></h2>
<p>While large cities may have some advantages over smaller cities in their ability to drive innovation, one disadvantage they face is that their network of peer cities is relatively small. There are only so many cities the size of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami—only 10 cities in the U.S have populations over 1 million. In contrast, there are about 250 cities in the U.S. with populations between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Programs like What Works Cities provide small and mid-sized cities with a valuable opportunity to connect and collaborate with their peers, including an upcoming second annual </span><a href="https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/summit/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Summit </span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">in New York City in which hundreds of mayors, city leaders and frontline practitioners will gather to learn from experts and exchange ideas. And a new certification program being rolled out by What Works Cities will provide an opportunity for even more cities to participate in the initiative and join its growing network; any U.S. city with a population of 30,000 or more will be welcome to apply.</span></p>
<p>As cities like Syracuse have demonstrated, being able to leverage ideas from peers is a key component of driving innovation and adopting data-driven strategies.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight:400;">Ruthless Adaptation of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>The real power of open source software (the idea that the code that makes up software solutions should be freely available to all) and open data is that it enables one to build on the work of others—to adapt someone else’s work to solve your own problem. The principles behind open source and open data allow smaller cities to borrow ideas from other places and to punch above their weight on innovation.</p>
<p>Cities like Syracuse are great at ruthlessly adapting ideas that are at work in other places to solve their own local problems and improve the ways they provide services to residents. But knowing where to look to find good ideas can often be a challenge; smaller cities need to know which cities are leading the way in using data to allocate scarce resources more efficiently or inform new policy choices.</p>
<p>What Works Cities promises to address this challenge through its new certification program, which establishes a comprehensive standard for evaluating the data and evidence work being done in cities. This new standard will help to identify and nationally recognize the work of cities that are excelling in how they use data to transform what they do and allow other cities to emulate their efforts by borrowing their best ideas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the way that small and mid-sized cities will drive innovation and the adoption of data-driven governance in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p>The Syracuse Way!</p>

<p id="6771" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I’ve had the opportunity recently to talk to people in several different city governments that are facing a common challenge — <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">how to liberate operational data from a legacy system</span>.</p>
<p id="fdb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is a challenge that lots of city governments face, and it strikes me that there are some common lessons that can be derived from cities that have gone down this road already for those that are still trying to figure out the right approach.</p>
<p id="0867" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The following suggestions are crafted from my own experience as a municipal government official charged with making data more widely available, and those of people in similar positions that I’ve had a chance to speak with.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span id="more-4739"></span></p>
<p id="538a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hope this helps someone in a city government that is currently facing this challenge.</p>
<h3 id="a933" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem</h3>
<p id="08fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You’ve got operational data in a legacy system that you want to make more easily available to users inside of (and outside of) your city government.</p>
<p id="8565" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This may be a part of a larger data or analytics strategy that is spinning up, or a one-off request from the Mayor or other political leader for a specific project. Regardless of how it landed in your lap, the job is yours now.</p>
<p id="9a6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">You’ve got to figure out the best way to provide access to data in a legacy system in a way that is both useful for others and maintainable by you</span>.</p>
<h3 id="fde9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Some Hurdles You’ll Face</h3>
<p id="0982" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You probably won’t have additional resources allocated to support this project, and if the system in question is a bespoke solution created by a vendor they may want to charge you a handsome sum to do the work for you.</p>
<p id="e88e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If this is one of the first projects you’re undertaking to get operational data out of a legacy system for other purposes, you may not have a lot of the policy and technology infrastructure in place to support what you want to do. In a way this is a good thing — you have a greenfield opportunity to help shape policy and set up infrastructure that can be used to support a broader data strategy for your city. On the other hand, you’ll probably have to figure out what you need to get the job done on your own. As issues or questions arise, It will be your job to figure out how to address them.</p>
<p id="ca37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, you’ll have to make some definite choices technology wise. The good news is there are lots of different options for liberating data in legacy systems, and many are low cost and leverage open source software. However, different solutions may require different levels of technical expertise — some or all of which may be absent from your current IT environment. You’ll need to figure out how to introduce some new tools to your environment and — hopefully — keep them aligned with the skill sets of your staff and consistent with established IT policies.</p>
<p id="f1a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With these challenges in mind, here is a description of one approach that cities are using to take data from a legacy system and make it more easily usable by people inside and outside city government.</p>
<h3 id="548b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Extract, Transform, Load</h3>
<p id="4b84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first step in liberating data from a legacy system is to make a copy of it.</p>
<p id="a382" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This seems pretty straightforward but it’s worth emphasizing as you consider how to get started. The use of your data for analytics and other purposes should occur outside of the environment your legacy system is currently running in.</p>
<p id="7b9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Your goal here is to make a separate copy of your production data that is stored outside of the production system that is using it. You want this copy to be as close to identical to your production data as possible (with the caveat that there there may be data in your legacy system that is not appropriate to share, or that is unable to be shred because of existing policy). And since regular usage of your production system will cause your copy to become stale over time, you want to make the process of generating a copy repeatable at regular (preferable short) intervals.</p>
<p id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This sequence of steps is generally referred to in the world of data management as Extract, Transform, Load (ETL). It’s a common need and there are a number of tools and approaches that can be used to do it well. That said, it can be difficult to cut through the noise around ETL, sift through the competing options, and select an approach or solution that is affordable and maintainable. Additionally, for governments that have a heterogeneous technology environment with lots of different legacy systems, more than one ETL approach may be required.</p>
<p id="0e4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluating the ETL lifecycle in reverse can be a helpful way work through the issues:</p>
<h4 id="7cb0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Load</h4>
<p id="ab7c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Where are you going to put your data once you get it out of your legacy system?</p>
<p id="38fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A relational database platform (RDBMS) of some flavor probably makes the most sense. You can use an RDBMS with a whole bunch of commercially available reporting tools, and an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://redash.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">increasing</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/ankane/blazer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">number</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.cluvio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cloud-based</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> tools. You can also use it to build an API (more on this below).</p>
<p id="f75b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Already got a database environment and licenses? You’re probably good to go. If not, think about where you’re going to house your data (on a machine racked in your data center, or somewhere in the cloud) and select a database solution that is a good fit for your current IT environment and employee’s skill sets.</p>
<h4 id="6173" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Transform</h4>
<p id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The amount of transformation you’ll need to do on your data before loading it will depend on the system it is coming from. If your legacy data is already in an RDBMS you might be able to skip over this step and simply replicate from your production database to a backup.</p>
<p id="647a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At a minimum, particularly if your data is in an older legacy system, you may need to extract it into an intermediate format (e.g., CSV) and alter it before loading it into another database. This is almost always a pretty solid approach — there are lots of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tools</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/scripts/csvsql.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">available</a> for managing and manipulating these kinds of files, and for loading them into an RDBMS. These tools are scriptable and can be automated, making them easy to drop into your ETL toolchain.</p>
<p id="41d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If extracts from your legacy system are initially going to be infrequent (once a month or once a week) then you may be able to work through this process manually at first. As extracts become more frequent, you can start automating it incrementally, with the goal of having regular, frequent extracts occurring in a completed automated way.</p>
<h4 id="c169" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extract</h4>
<p id="d8eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the part of the ETL process that you don’t get to choose. Your data is in the system that it’s in — your challenge is to get it out of that system in a way that won’t disrupt its current operation and that is maintainable by you and/or other city IT staff.</p>
<p id="7ecf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If your data is already in an RDBMS, then there are undoubtedly utilities available to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms151198.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replicate</a> or <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://sqlserverdump.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">backup</a> data (hopefully you are already using them). You should evaluate these options to decide which is best given your current scenario.</p>
<p id="9240" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It your data is in an older system like an <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/industry_insiders/2008/10/01/sql-server-using-ssis-to-retrieve-data-from-as400/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AS/400</a> or a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3438/importing-mainframe-data-with-sql-server-integration-services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mainframe system</a>, you may need to create a custom solution for extracting data. If you have vendors supporting these systems, you can inquire about potential approaches and pricing. But keep in mind — these systems are pretty common in municipal government. Your counterparts in other local governments face this same challenge and some have already figured out how to do it efficiently. Communicating with other government IT officials might be one of your most effective mechanism for extracting data from older legacy systems.</p>
<p id="ef6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once you’ve identified an ETL approach that works for you, you will have a copy of your production data in a separate system that is now ready to use. Depending on who wants to use this data, and how they want to use it, you’ll have several options for what to do next.</p>
<h3 id="fbe5" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Making Use of Your Data</h3>
<p id="47a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Replicating production data so that people in operation and policy offices can run reports is a pretty common use case. If this was the driver for liberating your data from a legacy system, then most of what remains is simply pointing your reporting tool of choice at your newly created database.</p>
<p id="2d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But if you want to enable other uses for your data — e.g., using it to support a custom dashboard or application — or if you’re not sure what all of the uses for your data will be — you have some more decisions to make.</p>
<p id="362b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One option that you have is to put your data in an open data platform. If your data liberation work is part of a larger effort to make data more accessible to external users, you may already have one of these (or you may soon be getting one). If not, then you can still use an open data platform to house your data for use in internal reporting, analytics and application development. There are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://gcn.com/articles/2015/07/10/open-data-portal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots of commercial and open source options</a> that can be run both on premise and in the cloud.</p>
<p id="4d3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another option is to create an API for your data. This will allow you to tailor the way that users can access the data in a way that most effectively matches their use case. This option will, however, require you to make some technology choices.</p>
<p id="78f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every modern programming language has frameworks for building APIs, and odds are that you’ve already got some APIs running in your current IT environment (even if you didn’t build them). If your IT organization is a Microsoft shop (which is pretty common in municipal government), <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.asp.net/web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">there are</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://nancyfx.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">great</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">options</a> for you to use to build an API. In addition, Microsoft’s Azure platform provides some nice options for hosting your data or your API application, as well as for <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">managing APIs</a>.</p>
<p id="1a3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Evaluate the options that most closely align with your current environment and that are a good fit for the talents of your existing IT staff, because odds are they are the ones that will have to manage it going forward.</p>
<h3 id="dbc6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What Comes Next?</h3>
<p id="ff5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Whether you’ve put your data in an open data portal or created a standalone API, you now have an interface that you can manage that allows people to access your data. There are a few things you’ll need to think about to manage it effectively in the long run:</p>

<li id="aa24" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Who gets to use your API? Will they be required to authenticate to use it, or provide a key with calls to your API?</li>
<li id="05e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you open up access to your API to a select group of users (e.g., those on your internal network, or at a specific IP range) or will it be available more broadly, for anyone to use?</li>
<li id="8d13" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you manage traffic to your API to prevent abuse or overuse by specific users?</li>
<li id="cd97" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">How will you monitor your API to ensure it is up and operating properly?</li>
<li id="170f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will you log requests to your API and do regular diagnostics?</li>
</ul>
<p id="c71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Beyond general management of your API, (whether you realize it or not) you’re also going to need to provide some support for users of your API:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="9923" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Will you provide examples to users for how they can make calls and get data from your API?</li>
<li id="5586" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Who do users contact if they are having a problem using your API?</li>
<li id="8a6f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Where do users go to ask questions, or learn more about how to use your API?</li>
<li id="723f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Will users (internal or external) be able to suggest changes or enhancements to your API?</li>
</ul>
<p id="ac8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">That’s a lot to consider for a project that you may not have explicitly chosen to undertake in the first place.</p>
<p id="657b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re working with a vendor that has provided an open data portal, many of the things listed above may be in place already. And your vendor will likely have experience working with other customers — when in doubt ask your vendor to provide you with examples of how other customers are addressing a common issue.</p>
<p id="259b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve built a custom API, here are a few tips to you get started thinking about the issues listed above:</p>
<h4 id="3bc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Lend users a hand</h4>
<p id="b63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Provide users with enough information to get them started using your API without having the have a human help them. Your IT staff will thank you.</p>
<p id="42a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Invest some time in creating user facing materials with examples of how to make calls to your API, and a list of frequently asked questions. The more information you provide up front that makes it easy for users to start using your API the less phone calls and emails you’ll need to respond to.</p>
<p id="11b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, set up a way for users to report issues — a shared email box that is checked regularly is a good way to get started.</p>
<p id="26fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Set up a way to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.runscope.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">monitor the uptime of your API</a> so you’ll know when it’s down. This will allow you to get it back up quickly and also <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">communicate to users</a> that you are aware of the problem (again, resulting in fewer phone calls and emails).</p>
<h4 id="1320" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Treat your API like a shared resource</h4>
<p id="d3f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You should treat an API like a shared resource because that’s exactly what it is — improperly managed, one consumers overuse of this resource can crowd out the legitimate use of others.</p>
<p id="36d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Requiring authentication for users is one way to keep track of who is using your API, and issuing API keys is another option. Keep in mind, though, that if users can’t sign up quickly and easily without human intervention, then your phone will start to ring (or your inbox will start to fill up).</p>
<p id="999e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You should strongly consider a way to rate limit usage of your API — there are a number of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/rate-limiting-and-throttling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">commercial</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://getkong.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open source</a> API tools that can help you do this. You should also give thought to a caching strategy to improve the performance of your API — this includes not only setting up a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://varnish-cache.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">proxy cache</a>but also sending the appropriate <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/http-caching" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">caching headers</a> with your API responses.</p>
<h4 id="1415" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Plan for the future</h4>
<p id="8630" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As your API gets used, the people using it will form opinions about what they like and what they don’t like. Give them a way to provide this input to you in a way that you can refer back to. This will help you prioritize changes and enhancements to your API going forward and ensure you are directing your finite resources to the things your users want most.</p>
<p id="88e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’ll also want to think about things like versioning your API to allow you to gracefully deprecate features and add new ones.</p>
<p id="d14a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Data APIs are increasingly common in government, and there are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://github.com/18F/api-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">lots</a> of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/application-programming-interfaces-apis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">guides</a> that can help you work through these issues.</p>
<p id="6c6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The challenge of getting operational data from a legacy system and using it to support an internal analytics project, or an external open data effort are increasingly common in municipal government. You’ll face challenges in getting started, but you can take comfort in knowing that lots of other local government IT leaders are traveling this same road. Sharing your experience and asking others to share theirs is an effective way of working through these issues.</p>
<p id="f989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Don’t let the fact that you don’t know everything keep you from doing the things you can do right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, I <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">wrote a book</a> devoted to civic hacking based on my experience working in state and local government, and inside civic tech communities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4723" data-permalink="https://civic.io/2017/02/14/read-my-book/book-picture/" data-orig-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png" data-orig-size="592,398" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="book-picture" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=592" class=" size-full wp-image-4723 aligncenter" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=1000" alt="book-picture" srcset="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png 592w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=150 150w, https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/book-picture.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px"   /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. The premise is simple &#8211; governments need to find more effective ways of collaborating with members of their local civic tech communities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Governments must develop strategies for engagement that can help direct the efforts of outside technology experts to issues or challenges that will have the broadest impact and the largest potential payoff. They will need to learn how to rally people with special talents to a particular cause or challenge, and then to turn those outside efforts into tangible outcomes for government agencies. They must learn to view the technology community as a potential talent pool from which they can draw a new generation of public servants who possess unique expertise in digital service creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s open source and available on Github. If you have a suggestion for how I can make it better, send a pull request or <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/issues">open a new issue</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you <a href="https://www.civichacking.guide/">enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p id="06dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These tools are more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.livestories.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plentiful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">powerful</a>, more <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://quickcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">flexible</a>, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://dataship.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">less expensive</a> than pretty much everything government employees currently have at their disposal. Governments may have exiting relationships with huge tech companies like Microsoft, IBM, Esri and others that have an array of different data tools — it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p id="6033" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the race for better data tools, the general public isn‘t just beating out the public sector, its already won the race and is taking a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/12760040/revisiting-bruce-jenner-historic-olympic-victory-1976-montreal-games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jenner-esque victory lap</a>.</p>

<p id="6858" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was a time when making a map on the internet required specialized skills and proprietary tools.

<p id="86ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe I’m emphasizing a point that is pretty obvious but for people that work inside government this has some implications. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">The process of using data to improve the way governments work is inextricably linked to how good governments are at engaging with outside data users.</span></p>
<p id="bcb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Public sector employees that want to use data to improve how government operates, enhance the quality of public services or help governments make better decisions will need to employ a new set of skills. It won’t be good enough to simply enhance internal capacity for data analysis or app development (although that’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://kcmo.gov/data/2016/09/12/data-data-data-introducing-kansas-citys-data-academy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pretty important</a> as well).</p>

<p id="f811" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is often a relatively new skill set for those in government IT departments and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@mheadd/bridging-the-citistat-gap-ef563328593f#.e7ofan41f" target="_blank">PerformanceStat programs</a> — where government data efforts commonly reside. These departments are typically inward facing — serving the needs of other agencies — and often don’t have long traditions of outside engagement.</p>
<p id="0f54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Its time for governments to reimagine their place in the civic technology production chain. More than ever, it is essential that governments assume their role as data stewards, enablers and conveners to bring the power of these new external tools to bear on the problems facing our communities.</p>
<p id="68be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other">For governments, outside engagement will turn out to be the most important new tool in the 21st Century data science toolkit.</span></p>

<p>The title of &#8220;Chief Data Officer&#8221; &#8211; once an uncommon one in state and municipal governments &#8211; is becoming less uncommon. And that’s a very good thing for public sector innovation.</p>
<p>As recently as a few years ago, Chief Data Officers were found almost exclusively in big city governments like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia. Municipal governments provide services that touch citizens’ lives in more intimate ways than states or the federal government, and big cities have a critical mass of data that is attractive to the growing community of users with powerful tools for mapping and analyzing data. So it’s no surprise that <a href="http://publicsource.org/investigations/wolfs-plan-for-open-data-promising-pennsylvania-has-its-work-cut-out-for-it#.V7MwZZMrJ-V">cities have led the way</a> in creating new, data-focused positions like CDOs, and in releasing open data to the public.</p>
<p>But increasingly, state governments and small to midsized cities are <a href="http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html">appointing Chief Data Officers</a>, and creating new positions that focus almost exclusively on data. For example, earlier this year the City of Syracuse (a city of approximately 145,000 in Central New York) appointed <a href="http://www.innovatesyracuse.com/blog/cdo">it’s very first Chief Data Officer</a>. It’s worth noting that this is not a stand alone position as in some other cities. The CDO position in Syracuse was deliberately made part of the city’s internal innovation team (which is funded through the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.org/program/government-innovation/innovation-teams/">Bloomberg Philanthropies iTeam program</a>) and plays an integral part in the city’s efforts to use data internally to provide services more efficiently.</p>
<p><span id="more-4708"></span></p>
<p>In many ways, the newest cohort of Chief Data Officers being appointed in states and smaller cities highlights an important change in priorities for the CDO position, and for how governments view data as a part of their innovation efforts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://opengovdata.org/">open data movement </a>&#8211; coordinated efforts to advocate for the release of data by governments in “open” formats &#8211; is an outgrowth of many earlier good government initiatives. The focus on transparency that was the hallmark of these early open data efforts largely informed the first cohort of Chief Data Officers in big cities like Chicago and Philadelphia. The first order of business for these newly appointed CDOs was the creation of <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/">public-facing web portals</a> that would allow external users to find and access government data. And while transparency remains a top priority of the open data movement, and building and expanding open data portals is still an important part a CDO’s work, the role of Chief Data Officer has started to evolve.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the focus of Chief Data Officers is on the internal use of data for more efficient resource allocation and improved operations. In other words, Chief Data Officers &#8211; once focused almost exclusively on making governments better <em>producers</em> of data &#8211; are increasingly focused on making governments better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>
<p>To some extent, this change in focus is born out of necessity. Governments at every level are under pressure to provide better service with limited resources. Data is a key element to streamlining operations and <a href="http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/municipal-analytics-the-startup-way-873">allocating scarce resources more efficiently</a>, and the tools and expertise for using data are becoming more attainable, even for smaller governments. But the more recent imperative for CDOs to enhance government operations using data and the original focus on government transparency are not mutually exclusive. In fact, these two areas of focus can complement each other, and help drive (and sustain) government innovation into the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic or organizational barriers often prevent the free flow of information inside government &#8211; it’s not uncommon for one department to have difficulty obtaining data or information from another. Open data portals make data more discoverable – they obviate the need for special relationships, access or political clout to obtain data. Anyone and everyone can see what data is available for use (including other government agencies), so fewer resources are spent hunting around for data and connecting with data owners.</p>
<p>When governments release data openly there are a number of very healthy incentives created by external data users. These users expect data to be complete, well documented and regularly updated – when this does not happen governments typically get quick feedback from unhappy users. Data that is regularly updated, well documented and otherwise easier to use has more value for every potential data user – including governments themselves.</p>
<p>So while the role of government Chief Data Officers is evolving, the traditional focus on transparency and sharing data with external users is still critical for governments to achieve their innovation goals.</p>
<p>A commitment to openness makes governments better <em>producers</em> of data, and better <em>consumers</em> of data.</p>

<p>The term “civic tech” gets used a lot, and it often means different things to different people. To me, this has always meant that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly &#8211; all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will ultimately be broad and durable. I’ve never been prone to excessive handwringing.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I believe very firmly that the most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all. Real people &#8211; with empathy and a desire to make their community better &#8211; are the most important kind of civic technology. A recently released report on civic technology by Omidyar Network entitled </span><a href="http://enginesofchange.omidyar.com/docs/OmidyarEnginesOfChange.pdf"><span style="font-weight:400;">Engines of Change</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> underscores this idea, and helps emphasize that the connections between people &#8211; both inside the civic tech community and outside it &#8211; are what&#8217;s most important to its future growth.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4676"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The report presents a blueprint of sorts for how those working in and supporting civic tech can help it grow in a way that deepens its impact and broadens its appeal. It very smartly highlights a set of opportunities for the different groups working in the civic tech ecosystem that each can follow to help civic tech grow. I think that those of us working in this sector should embrace these recommendations.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our findings show a critical link between cities and practitioners. Civic tech is not a sector that has been driven forward entirely outside of governmental systems. Rather, it has been built in partnership with key stakeholders inside and outside government&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most impactful of these recommendations for me are those directed toward governments and people working inside cities. The report urges these people to reach out to, engage with, and help grow the civic tech community. Having recently moved from a large city with an active and growing civic tech community, to a smaller city with no tradition of civic hacking and little organized engagement around data or technology, I can say emphatically that there seems to be an acute need here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Connecting with innovators outside government and helping to nurture external communities often falls outside the job description (and the skill set) of most public servants &#8211; even those tasked with running open data or innovation programs. Shoehorning these efforts into a traditional government IT department can </span><a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Philadelphias-IT-Reorganization-Receives-Barbs-and-Praise.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">shackle them to a bureaucratic infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> that often has little interest or expertise in outward engagement. Placing them in other parts of the organization may help with external focus but may also erode proximity to the part of the organization where important decisions about data and technology are made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finding the right approach to enable government employees to interact with and nurture external civic tech communities can be </span><a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/error-why-are-madison-s-open-data-and-civic-hacking/article_a25a8ffd-0afd-5016-ac6f-305b2217d2c3.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">a tough balance to strike</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. This can be particularly true in smaller municipalities with nascent open data and innovation programs, and smaller or more dispersed tech communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over the last few years we’ve seen a growth in the number of resources and tools available to municipal governments and civil servants to </span><a href="https://www.gitbook.com/@centerforgov"><span style="font-weight:400;">open up their data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, enact </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/"><span style="font-weight:400;">policies around innovation and technology</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, and to make better use of their data themselves. But there seems to be a noticeable lack of practical resources available to assist government officials with identifying and connecting with people outside of government in the civic tech community. Civic tech can’t flourish unless we educate and support municipal officials in their outreach to these groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s why I’m working on creating </span><a href="https://civic.io/2016/06/21/meeting-in-the-middle/"><span style="font-weight:400;">a new guidebook for local government officials</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, building on my own experience in city government and the expertise of a host of others currently working in cities. This process will be open and collaborative, and the results will be released under a Creative Commons license for any government official to use. I hope this will help those in government embrace the opportunity highlighted in the Omidyar report &#8211; to “engage deeply with local civic tech communities.”</span></p>
<p>Municipal governments and other public sector officials need better tools, broader networks, and more information for building (and sustaining) relationships with outside innovators in civic tech. Building out these resources will help ensure that civic tech becomes what we all hope it can &#8211; and what cities and communities need it to become.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A powerful and enduring force for positive change.</span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Open-Data-APIs-Collecting-and-Consuming-What-Cities-Produce.html">an interesting piece</a> on open data APIs on GovTech that echos <a href="https://civic.io/2015/11/06/thinking-small-on-civic-tech/">a lot</a> of <a href="https://civic.io/2014/08/11/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-government-apis/">the</a> <a href="https://civic.io/2012/02/23/get-opengovernmentapis/">things</a> I&#8217;ve thought and said about government APIs over the past few years. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>APIs are an increasingly important way that governments make their open data available to outside users. Typically, when we talk about open data APIs (and I am as guilty of this as anyone) its almost always with a focus on either the technical underpinnings and data on one side, or the benefits that citizens will ultimately reap from the data being made available on the other.</p>
<p>There are far too seldom discussions of what lies in the middle of these two ends and how this critical piece ultimately helps make government open data APIs better and citizens better off.</p>
<p><span id="more-4666"></span></p>
<p>As powerful and important as APIs are to making open data available and improving how governments operate, the vast majority of citizens will never consume an API directly from a government data publisher. Most won&#8217;t know or care that data or a service they are using is built on data from a government API. Instead, they will most likely consume a finished product, app or service (or read a new story) that is built on data from an API or some other open data source.</p>
<p>What lies in the middle &#8211; between government APIs and citizens end users &#8211; is an important group of intermediaries (or <a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile/status/717715634226860033">infomediaries</a>). This group is made up of private technology companies, entrepreneurs, volunteer civic hackers, journalists, activists, storytellers and others. It&#8217;s an important group for governments to reach out to, engage with and nurture. Far too seldom in our discussions about how to build great open data APIs do we discuss the strategies and skills needed to do these things.</p>
<p>To help address this problem, and to give people inside government some strategies for engaging with outside data intermediaries, I&#8217;m working on a new guidebook that I hope to make available in the next few months.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This guidebook will be designed to help civil servants find and collaborate with people doing innovative and valuable work outside government, particularly those working with technology and data. It will list specific strategies that can be employed by those working in the bureaucracy to help them leverage the talents of smart, passionate people outside government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to this guidebook, or want to get a peek at an early draft, <a href="mailto:mheadd@gmail.com">hit me up</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important thing about civic technology has nothing to do with technology at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The term “civic technology” gets used a lot, and it may mean different things to different people. I think this highlights the fact that the work being done in this area is dynamic, growing, and evolving rapidly — all good things that suggest the impact of civic technology will be broad and durable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For me, the term civic technology is inextricably related to the world of </span><a href="https://civic.io/2014/11/06/the-collaborative-state/"><span style="font-weight:400;">civic hacking</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. I began my career in government in what I would describe as the “old fashioned way”: graduate school to study public administration followed by work on political campaigns. Having now worked for three different state and local governments in both the legislative and executive branches, I consider civic hacking and civic technology to be the future of how governments will deliver services.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-4654"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Distilled to its essence, civic hacking is the existence of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place, and a desire to effect change on that condition. That’s it. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems. Apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In a way, civic hacking is a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of </span><a href="http://www.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight:400;">open data</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces for interactions with their government. Outside parties have begun developing solutions on top of government-provided or maintained data, often to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For example, in cities like </span><a href="http://livinglotsnyc.org/#11/40.7300/-73.9900"><span style="font-weight:400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the repurposing of vacant properties, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to specific government agencies. These outside efforts are enabled by the </span><a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset?q=property"><span style="font-weight:400;">deliberate release of property information</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> by the cities like Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change the way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and, in many ways, an enormous opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This, to me, is the essence of civic technology. Civic tech provides solutions to help governments deliver services to citizens more efficiently. We might think of civic apps as a kind of “last mile” technology — the link between the traditional infrastructure of government technology and the tools people ultimately use to interact with and get information from government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The most important component of civic technology is that it requires active collaboration between people inside government, including elected officials and government employees, and those outside government, the people in the neighborhoods and communities being served by government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The old way of delivering government services is over. Civic technology — technology we build together — is the future.</span></p>

<p>Getting a speeding ticket in the State of New York can be a traumatic &#8211; and expensive &#8211; experience.</p>
<p>Drivers convicted of speeding often face <a href="http://www.dmv.org/ny-new-york/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php">penalties and fines</a>, and repeated or excessive offenses can result in the loss of a license. But in some places in New York State, drivers issued a speeding ticket may see a very different outcome than one would typically expect: a smaller fine, the avoidance of long-term penalties, and &#8211; oddly enough &#8211; additional money in local government coffers.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a post detailing some data science techniques that <a href="https://civic.io/2015/02/03/command-line-data-science/">used a data set from the State of New York</a> on traffic violations. This is an <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">incredibly rich data set</a> and it&#8217;s awesome that the state makes this available as open data. However, the issuance of traffic tickets only tells part of a larger story &#8211; since the release of this initial data set, the state has now released data on <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">traffic ticket convictions</a>. Comparing both of these data sets allows us to see the full picture of what happens when a traffic ticket is issued in the State of New York, from issuance all the way through to adjudication.</p>
<p>An examination of these data sets show that &#8211; in certain areas of the state &#8211; tickets issued for speeding are much more likely to be negotiated down to a lessor offense that allows drivers to avoid a penalty from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), and actually provides a backdoor benefit for local governments.</p>
<p><span id="more-4623"></span></p>
<p><strong>A Lesser Offense </strong></p>
<p>There is a longstanding practice in New York State that allows local courts where traffic violations are adjudicated to accept a plea bargain for a lessor offense from some drivers that are issued tickets for speeding. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any hard and fast set of rules governing this behavior, but what I have found through research suggests that at the judge or prosecutor&#8217;s discretion motorists that don&#8217;t have prior speeding violations and/or weren&#8217;t speeding excessively may be allowed to plead down to a non-moving violation. These lessor offenses typically aren&#8217;t reported to DMV so they don&#8217;t result in <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/about-nys-driver-point-system">points against a driver&#8217;s license</a>. The fines owed for these non-moving violations may be lower than the fines for speeding, and because of the nature of the offense all of the fine revenue goes to the local jurisdiction, not the state.</p>
<p>This would seem to create a perverse incentive for local jurisdictions to allow drivers to plead down speeding tickets, and some proposals have been made to <a href="http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?aid=/20130126/cityandregion/130129321/1010">alter the practice</a>. Funding municipal operations through fines and penalties has led to <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-ferguson-missouri-court-fines-budget.html">serious issues in other parts of the country</a>, and we should be concerned that this practice may result in an uneven (and unfair) application of the law. Whether or not a motorist should be allowed to plead down to a lesser offense should be based on factors other than whether the local jurisdiction wants or needs the revenue to fund their operations.</p>
<p>Now &#8211; thanks to the State of New York&#8217;s open data efforts &#8211; we have data that can be used to determine how widespread this practice is, and make some recommendations for what policy makers should do going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at the Data</strong></p>
<p>Once the data from the state&#8217;s portal is loaded into a local <acronym title="Relational Database management System">RDBMS</acronym> (more on this in the technical notes below), we can run queries against it. For the purposes of this analysis, we wanted to determine the <em>conviction rate</em> for speeding tickets for each local court in the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">convictions data set</a>. To do this, we need to count up the number of tickets issued for speeding violations that get assigned to each local court and compare it the number of convictions for speeding offenses for that court. In other words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>speeding convictions / speeding tickets issues = conviction rate</strong></p>
<p>In running queries against the data, it probably makes sense to limit our analysis to jurisdictions where a non-trivial number of speeding tickets are issued. If pleading down tickets to lesser offenses creates an unwanted incentive for local officials, this is probably more likely to occur in places the local revenue generated from this practice is more significant.</p>
<p>So, if we restrict our analysis to jurisdictions where 10,000 or more speeding tickets were issued over the four year period covered by the state&#8217;s data, we get the following.</p>

</pre>
<p>At the top of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lowest</span> conviction rates for speeding tickets issued &#8211; we see the City of Tonawanda (not to be confused with the Town of Tonawanda, which is also on the list)  located in Western New York near Buffalo. The rate of conviction on speeding tickets in the City of Tonawanda is about 7.5%. The Town of Hamburg and the Town of Amherst &#8211; which also have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets &#8211; are also in Western NY.</p>
<p>Overall, the list includes areas with major highways and significant traffic levels &#8211; Clarkstown, Yonkers, Suffolk and Southampton are all downstate and Long Island, and Troy and Guilderland are in the Capital Region &#8211; which are places where we would expect to see lots of traffic tickets issued. If we look at how the practice of pleading down traffic violations plays out in terms of local revenue, we can see that it may provide significant support for some jurisdictions. In the <a href="http://www.ci.tonawanda.ny.us/treasurer/budget_2015_and_supporting_documentation.pdf">City of Tanowanda</a>, fine revenue represents about $475,000 annually &#8211; about 6.5% of total city revenue (excluding state aid). Not the largest revenue source by any stretch, but certainly enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the list &#8211; meaning places that have the highest rates of convictions for speeding tickets are the various <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/tickets/find-tvb-office-locations">Traffic Violation Bureaus</a>. These are run by the state DMV, so there is no incentive to plead down speeding tickets to lesser offenses and generate local revenue. In fact, I don&#8217;t think plea bargains are allowed at these facilities. This means that for some areas &#8211; like Western NY &#8211; drivers may see the final adjudication of their speeding ticket handled very differently depending on where it is issued (or, more accurately, depending on the court it is assigned to).</p>
<p>Around the City of Buffalo there are a number of jurisdictions &#8211; Tonawanda, Amherst, Hamburg, Cheektowanga &#8211; that have very low conviction rates for speeding tickets. But within the City of Buffalo (where speeding tickets are adjudicated by the Traffic Violation Bureau) the conviction rates are much higher.</p>
<p><strong>Where Do We Go From Here?</strong></p>
<p>The current situation, where drivers issued speeding tickets are allowed to plead down to lesser offenses and generate local revenue, seems far from ideal for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>The practice of supporting municipal operations through penalty and fine revenue can create <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/doj-warns-local-courts-in-u-s-about-use-of/article_b9b8afd6-74e1-5303-ae3d-c3492514714e.html">perverse incentives</a> and undermine people&#8217;s confidence in the impartiality of government officials. Because there are no hard and fast rules governing how different jurisdictions allow drivers to plead to lesser offenses, there is no way to make sure that this opportunity is being evenly applied. Do men and women plead at the same rate? Do minorities plead at the same rate as whites? The data currently available don&#8217;t allow us to evaluate these questions, but the quasi-formal nature of the practice should raise concerns.</p>
<p>Moreover, the incentive created by this practice should be particularly concerning from a traffic safety perspective. The penalties and fines established for speeding are put in place for a reason &#8211; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.21798/abstract">they work</a>, by reducing the incidence of fatal accidents and loss of life. Permitting speeders a chance to plea to a lesser offense allows potentially dangerous drivers to remain on the road with little consequence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all state policy makers see it this way. In Buffalo &#8211; where this analysis shows the imbalance between conviction rates is stark &#8211; state legislators have in recent years <a href="http://wivb.com/2014/06/20/coming-soon-to-buffalo-talking-down-traffic-tickets/">moved to allow speeders in the city to plead to a lesser offense</a>, the same opportunity afforded ticketed drivers in surrounding towns and villages.</p>
<p>This is a move in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Local governments &#8211; particularly in Upstate New York &#8211; are strapped financially, burdened by crumbling infrastructure and face a host of challenges in funding their operations. But we should not allow the practice of pleading down speeding tickets to be used as a way to provide a financial crutch to New York&#8217;s ailing local governments. Policy makers should eliminate this practice altogether.</p>
<p>Supporting local governments shouldn&#8217;t require making our highways and roadways less safe.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Notes: Here&#8217;s How I Obtained and Used the Data</strong></p>
<p>The logic for calculating conviction rates is contained in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-rate-sql">couple of stored procedures</a> &#8211; one to determine the conviction rate for speeding tickets for a given year, and the other to calculate it over the four year period that both data sets cover (this is the one used to generate the table shown above). This is obviously not to most elegant or efficient SQL, but for the purposes of this analysis it will do the job.</p>
<p>All of the data used in this analysis is available from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/">State of New York&#8217;s open data portal</a> and cover the period from 2011 &#8211; 2014. Specifically, I make use of the traffic ticket data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Tickets-Issued-Four-Year-Window/q4hy-kbtf">here</a>, and the traffic ticket conviction data set <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/DMV-Reportable-Traffic-Ticket-Conviction-Counts-by/gwz5-m9ja">here</a>. Since I want to combine data from both sets, I opted to download both and load them into a local RDBMS so I could run <acronym title="Structured Query Language">SQL</acronym> queries on them.</p>
<p>The traffic ticket data set is rather large &#8211; over 14 million rows. It contains one record for each ticket issued along with descriptive information about the violation, when it was issued and the court it was assigned to for adjudication. For the purposes of this analysis, we are interested in tickets issued for speeding, so we confine our queries to a subset of all tickets with the set of descriptions <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-violation-descriptions-md">listed here</a>. This list was generated by selecting violation descriptions with the word <code>SPEED</code> in them &#8211; a little simplistic but not a bad way to start. A few of the ticket categories seem out of place &#8211; like <code>UNLAWFUL SPEEDOMETER</code> and <code>VEH WITH PERFORMANCE SPEED LESS THAN 55 MPH REG-9</code> &#8211; so for now, we&#8217;ll drop them from our analysis.</p>
<p>The conviction data set contains aggregate counts of convictions for specific violation types (in this analysis, I focused on <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-conviction-descriptions-md">this set</a>). Since these are aggregate counts, we can&#8217;t tie specific tickets to an outcome in a local court (at least not with these data sets). However, we can look at each court and sum up the types of convictions that occur for a given time period. Since the ticket data set includes information on the court each ticket was assigned to, we can create a view of how many tickets issued for speeding in the State of New York were plead down to lesser offenses and in which jurisdictions the practice is more prevalent.</p>
<p>I should note that the conviction data set needed a bit of tweaking before I could conduct this analysis. The format for the <code>Court_Name</code> field was slightly different from the ticket data set, and this was the field I wanted to use to match ticket counts to conviction counts. Using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a>, I was able to modify this data set and add a new column named <code>Standard_Court_Name</code> that used the same naming convention as the ticket data set. As such, the table structure for this data set in my local database <a href="https://gist.github.com/mheadd/350751562f651eccd7417cf2946d187c#file-data-load-sql">differs slightly</a> from the structure of the data available on the NYS data portal.</p>
