										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Philadelphia is experimenting with some new ideas that we hope will change the way that city departments procure technology solutions. The &#8220;petrie dish&#8221; for some of the more interesting of these experiments is the social coding site <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h4>The Background</h4>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/github.png?w=256&#038;h=256" alt="GitHub logo" width="256" height="256" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Philadelphia is looking for ways to partner more closely with local technology companies on small to mid-sized technology projects undertaken by city departments. One of the biggest challenges we face in creating these partnerships is our procurement process, which wasn&#8217;t designed in a way that is conducive to working with small companies and startups. This is not a new problem, and there are actually <a href="http://mayorschallenge.bloomberg.org/index.cfm?objectid=184AE090-8B49-11E2-92C8000C29C7CA2F">initiatives</a> underway in Philadelphia to mitigate this challenge and create valuable partnerships with local startups.</p>
<p>One of the unique characteristics of Philadelphia&#8217;s procurement system is the process used for &#8220;Miscellaneous Purchase Orders&#8221; (MPOs). MPOs are are personal and professional services contracts valued at $30,000 or less for which city departments are required to obtain quotes from no less than three different vendors. Traditionally, the process of outreach to vendors for MPO projects has been decentralized and opaque. Department personnel would (and still do) reach out to vendors that they are personally aware of and obtain a quote for services.</p>
<p>This traditional practice is suboptimal for city departments because the pool of vendors from which quotes are obtained is limited. It is also not optimal for local vendors, many of whom may be qualified to provide the service desired but who may be unaware of the opportunity.</p>
<p>With the support of Philadelphia&#8217;s  Deputy Mayor of Administration &amp; Coordination and Managing Director, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichNegrin">Rich Negrin</a>, and at the direction of the Chief Innovation Officer, <a href="https://twitter.com/adelebeid">Adel Ebeid</a>, we are experimenting with ways to change this practice for MPO projects (starting with technology projects), and we&#8217;re using GitHub to do it.</p>
<h4>The Overview</h4>
<p>$30,000 may not seem like a sizable budget for a big city project, but for some technology projects &#8211; specifically things like web site redesigns, mobile app development, etc. &#8211; this amount can go a long way, and provide ample funding for a small or mid sized effort. It&#8217;s probably not the right budget for larger companies but for small companies, or even freelance developers, this is nothing to sneeze at. It is these small companies that we want to create new partnerships with &#8211; today&#8217;s small startup is (potentially) tomorrow&#8217;s big company.</p>
<p>Philadelphia has a thriving technology community, and a robust network of developers and designers who would be ideal for many of the projects that city departments undertake as MPO projects. But until recently, there hasn&#8217;t been a mandate to rework how we conduct outreach for quotes on MPO projects. In addition, there hasn&#8217;t been the right concentration of knowledge within city government to think outside the box and try some new ways of doing old things.</p>
<p>The Managing Director and CIO have given the Innovation Management Team in the Office of Innovation and Technology latitude to try new things. A good chunk of this team is made up of former civic hackers, most of whom have collaborated on software projects with other developers in the past. When we got the green light to think of some new strategies, our collective interest settled almost immediately on GitHub.</p>
<h4>The Experiment</h4>
<p>We decided to try and use GitHub &#8211; from start to finish &#8211; as the mechanism for soliciting bids on a new technology project for the City of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>There are lots of reasons that we decided to use GitHub for this experiment. First, we wanted to utilize a platform that would resonate with technologists (duh, Github). Second, we wanted to have some insight into the quality of other work done by bidders &#8211; we expected that firms interested in bidding would already have GitHub accounts, allowing us to look at public repos to see what kind of solutions they were working on and how active they were in participating in other projects.</p>
<p>And finally, we were hopeful that by doing something different &#8211; something that potential vendors probably had not seen from a city government before &#8211; that we would encourage some &#8220;creative&#8221; responses.</p>
<p>To conduct our experiment, we needed the right project. The one we ended up choosing is called <strong>myPhillyRising</strong> &#8211; it involves the development of a mobile app to support the efforts of the <a href="http://www.phila.gov/mdo/phillyrising/">PhillyRising</a> Collaborative. PhillyRising is a &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; effort that is run under the auspices of the Managing Director&#8217;s Office. It places city staff in some of the toughest neighborhoods in Philadelphia to support residents that want to bring together their neighbors and organize community events and address chronic neighborhood problems. The objective of the mobile app is to give both PhillyRising staff and residents in the neighborhoods they serve an easy to use tool for communicating, sharing information and organization events.</p>
<p>The first thing we wanted to do was to post the description of the myPhillyRising project publicly, to enable us to share it widely through various channels with our local technology community. We decided to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/PhillyCDO/4666456">a simple GituHub Gist</a> for this.</p>
<p>We asked interested parties that had questions to post them as a comment on this public Gist, allowing other interested parties to see both the question and our answers. For those that wanted to submit a response, we asked them to do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If they didn&#8217;t have a paid GitHub account, we asked that they create <a href="https://github.com/blog/1276-welcome-to-a-new-gist">a private Gist</a> containing their response and send us a link for review.</li>
<li>For those with paid GitHub accounts, we asked that they <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository">create a new private repo</a> containing their response and invite us to be collaborators on that repo.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>While we anticipated that the process of using GitHub to solicit bids would be interesting, the response that we got from local vendors &#8211; and the nature of some of these responses &#8211; exceeded our expectations.</p>
<h4>The Outcome</h4>
<p>By the end of the submission process, we had received 9 high quality responses from local vendors &#8211; a number that far outstrips the number of responses received for similar MPO projects, and three times the number of responses required. This underscores the importance of publicly posting opportunities of this kind &#8211; if the city gives local technologists an opportunity to bid on work, local companies will respond.</p>
<p>In addition, several of the responses were highly creative &#8211; responding firms took advantage of the fact that the submission platform was a GitHub repo and made the most of the opportunity. One firm created a compelling webpage using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to tell the story of Philadelphia residents who might use the new mobile app &#8211; they didn&#8217;t do this in addition to their standard response, this <em>was</em> their response. Another firm committed prototype code to their repo that let the evaluation team test drive how the proposed app might look and work on a mobile device.</p>
<p>Beyond the initial submissions from interested firms, we found that <a href="https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation">GitHub Issues</a> were an effective means of interacting with respondents. We used this mechanism for followup questions, to request additional information and even to help us schedule in person meetings with finalists.</p>

<p>Going into the final vendor selection, we expect to use the original GitHub repo that was set up to submit vendor responses  as the mechanism for delivering the final working mobile application (and for all of the iterations and code reviews leading up to that point).</p>
<p>And ultimately, if we decide to release the code for the myPhillyRising app as an open source project, we can add the appropriate license and flip the winning vendor&#8217;s repo from private to public.</p>
<h4>The Road Ahead</h4>
<p>This experiment focused on a specific kind of city project. Even within the universe of MPO projects (which represents only part of the larger procurement picture), this effort was very narrowly focused on technology projects. This represents just a drop in the bucket of what the City of Philadelphia spends on technology projects.</p>
<p>That said, this exercise has given us valuable insights into ways that we can make the process of engaging with local technology companies easier and more efficient. The latitude provided by the MDO and CIO gave the project team room to try something that the city had never done before. </p>
<p>We are now expanding our efforts to reach out to local technology companies for small to mid-sized technology projects  &#8211; aggregating new projects that have the right profile to <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/">a central website</a> (a simple WordPress-based site) to make them easy to find and allow users to set up <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/subscribe/">subscriptions</a> for the kind of projects they are interested in. This will not be the last project to use GitHub as an integral part of the vendor selection process, and we are actively looking for ways to integrate GitHub into the processes used to interact with vendors on these projects.</p>
<p>We have much more work to do, but the steps that the City of Philadelphia is taking to engage more efficiently with small, nimble, local technology companies is really exciting. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool to see GitHub being used as a part of these efforts. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been almost 10 months since I wrote a post on this site about <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/06/five-things-governments-can-do-to-encourage-civic-startups/">steps that governments can take</a> to encourage and support civic startups, and over 2 years since <a href="https://civic.io/2010/05/05/open-data-its-about-the-economy-stupid/">my first post</a> on the connection between open data and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see high ranking public officials like Federal CTO Todd Park and Energy Secretary Steven Chu <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/10/01/energy-datapalooza-unleashing-power-open-data-advance-our-energy-future">talking about spurring entrepreneurs and innovation</a> with open data.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sw.jpeg?w=215&#038;h=234" alt="Startup Weekend" title="Startup Weekend" width="215" height="234" style="float:right;padding:10px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also really cool to see more and more startup focused events looking at open data from governments as the fuel for new ventures. I got to attend a <a href="http://philly.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend event in Philadelphia</a> this past weekend, and there was a high level of interest in using open data from the City as part of several projects. The same weekend, there were <a href="https://twitter.com/aquafire406/status/251909825661923328">similarly themed events</a> happening in Baltimore, with <a href="https://twitter.com/sharon_paley/status/251833408496472064">similar comments</a> from city officials there.</p>
<p>Cities in particular are stewards of <a href="http://www.data.gov/communities/cities">vast amounts of data</a> that can be used as the basis for useful apps and successful business ventures. In addition, the solutions built with this data can help address challenges that cities grapple with on a persistent basis.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re close to figuring out the alchemy for using open data to support new business ventures <strong>and</strong> to help address social problems. They fact that conversations on this point have gone mainstream among public officials is just a sign that we&#8217;re getting closer.</p>
<p>I believe that Philadelphia will be the city that figures it out first &#8211; <a href="http://christopherwink.com/2011/12/19/social-entrepreneurship-how-philadelphia-could-have-a-regional-distinction-for-startups/">the thinking here on this front</a> is far clearer than in other places, and its helping guide our efforts around open data, civic hacking and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The last quarter of 2012 will see awesome startup and hacking events in Philly that will help push our understanding of how best to use open data to build successful business ventures. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a fun way to close out the year &#8211; looking forward to it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a little over six weeks ago, Code for America opened up applications for the CfA <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/">Startup Accelerator</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/accelerator_logo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=102" alt="" title="Code for America Accelerator" width="300" height="102" style="float:right;padding:5px;margin-left:10px;" /></p>
<p>Honestly, when we did, we thought we would receive maybe a dozen or two applications. We weren’t sure if folks would know what we meant by “civic,” or be able to hear about it soon enough to apply; or even if they did, we couldn’t be certain they’d want to step up. Knowing full well that the market might be small, however, we chose to push ahead anyway, since we were just looking for a small first class, and we figured we could, if nothing else, learn about the scale of the space.</p>
<p>Turns out, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/06/07/over-230-startups-apply-to-code-for-america/">we were wrong</a>. </p>

<p>Following that post came the formal launch of the <a href="https://civic.io/2012/02/17/urban-apps-maps-studio-launches-in-philadelphia/">Urban Apps &amp; Maps Studio in Philadelphia</a>.  But another accelerator program in Baltimore, that had been in the formative stages, seems to have hit a dead end with the abrupt departure of that city&#8217;s CIO.</p>
<p><span id="more-2484"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited to write about a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/">brand new accelerator program</a> that is now accepting applications, brought to you by Code for America (where I now work).</p>
<p>The idea behind the CfA accelerator is simple &#8211; the availability of high-quality open government data, and the increasing awareness that government has largely missed the boat on new <acronym title="Software as a Service">SaaS</acronym> and <acronym title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</acronym> offerings that are helping to power private sector companies has created a unique opportunity. Companies like <a href="http://www.seeclickfix.com/">SeeClickFix</a>, <a href="https://turbovote.org/register/start">TurboVote</a> and <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a> are leading the way, and there are a host of smart, talented people with new ideas looking to shake things up in how government works.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re part of a civic startup, looking to disrupt the way that government does business or provides service to its citizens, you should consider applying.</p>
<p>This is your chance &#8211; don&#8217;t miss it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, at the <a href="http://design.temple.edu/">Fox School of Business</a> at Temple University, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter helped launch the Urban Apps &amp; Maps Studio &#8211; a civic business incubator that will support the development of software applications to address urban issues in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The video below &#8211; by former Code for America fellow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/annabloom">Anna Bloom</a> &#8211; provides a nice overview of the focus of the new Apps &amp; Maps Studio.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/35927736" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/35927736">Introducing Urban Apps &amp; Maps Studio</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/annabloom">Anna Bloom</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The Studio, which will be led by Fox School of Business Professor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/YoungjinYoo">Youngjin Yoo</a>, is <a href="http://www.fox.temple.edu/posts/2011/09/temple-university-receives-700000-in-grants-to-create-urban-apps-maps-studio/">supported by $700,000 in grants from the federal government</a>, and has the support and partnership of the City of Philadelphia and Code for America.</p>
<p><span id="more-224"></span></p>
<p>Leading up to the announcement by Mayor Nutter, the Fox School of Business held it&#8217;s second annual <a href="http://design.temple.edu/designchallenge-2012/">Design Challenge</a> which brings graduate, college and high school students together to identify problems facing the north Broad Street neighborhood (where Temple University is located).</p>
<p>Ideas generated at the Design Challenge will be used as the focus of activities in upcoming hackathon events around the city, and the hope is that these ideas will one day soon return to Temple University in the form of new business ventures to be incubated in the Urban Apps &amp; Maps studio.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ambitious vision, but with the support and partners lined up behind the Studio this looks like it might be the right combination of elements to generate sustainable business ventures around civic solutions.</p>
<p>Ideas from the Design Challenge will be introduced to hackers at an upcoming <a href="http://codeforamerica.ticketleap.com/codeacrossamerica2012/">Code for America hackathon</a> taking place in Philadelphia on February 25th.</p>
<p>It will be exciting to see the outcomes from this important effort. Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the next few weeks civic accelerator programs will be launched in several East Coast cities, building on the momentum started by the announcement of the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/accelerator/">Code for America (CfA) backed civic accelerator in San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/vroom.jpg?w=300&#038;h=168" alt="vroom" title="vroom" width="300" height="168" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;padding:5px;" /></p>
<p>As I <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/civic_io/status/169742387181129728">telegraphed in a tweet</a> earlier today, announcements for these new efforts are imminent. </p>
<p>Clearly the idea of building viable businesses out of civic projects that use open government data or that leverage government transparency is catching on. What remains to be seen is the specific approach these initiatives will take.</p>
<p>Beyond the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/06/BUCB1MLF3F.DTL">kick off announcement</a> of the San Francisco-based accelerator program, there are very few details of exactly how the effort will work, and CfA is still <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/01/05/opportunity-build-run-the-cfa-accelerator/">recruiting for someone</a> to lead the venture.</p>
<p>The announcements that will be made on the east coast in the near term will provide more concrete information on exactly how these accelerator programs will work, and offer a glimpse into how supporters believe they can spin civic hacking projects into profitable ventures.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch as the upcoming announcements are made. Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great article in TechPresident today about <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/21676/san-francisco-push-accelerate-government-20-economic-development-tool-could-just-be">San Francisco&#8217;s efforts to start a civic accelerator</a> with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, and what other cities are doing to implement the same idea in their own way.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Government 2.0 geeks will no doubt find the news exciting and look to San Francisco as a beacon illuminating the way forward in a year when more local governments contemplate leveraging their work with the tech sector — not just being a booster for their local tech industries, but actually doing business with the companies within it — an economic development tool.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people were afraid of looking a little crazy, but now San Francisco has gone ahead and done it and made the idea legit,” says Mark Headd, a civic hacking advocate who is former chief policy adviser to Delaware’s tech and information department.</p>
<p>Headd has been urging local governments to think of open data as an economic development tool for <a href="http://www.voiceingov.org/blog/?p=1782">some time</a>. In particular, he has argued in the past that financially strapped states could leverage the data in lieu of loans and grants to stimulate the creation and growth of small businesses.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Expect to see some cool stuff on this front from Baltimore (mentioned in the article) and Philadelphia in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote a post listing <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/06/five-things-governments-can-do-to-encourage-civic-startups/">five things that governments can do in 2012 </a> to encourage and foster civic startups.</p>
<p>Though the month of January is not yet over, we now an interesting case study developing in the City of Chicago that highlights the overwhelming importance of one of these five items to the future success of civic startups &#8211; government procurement reform.</p>
<p><span id="more-120"></span></p>
<p>In my earlier post, I used the example of the <a href="http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/docs/Spec101998.pdf">City of Chicago&#8217;s RFP</a> for an online lobbyist registration application as a way to underscore how out of line the current procurement system is in most cities with the startup ecosystem.  The City&#8217;s RFP, somewhat unexpectedly it seems, drew a response from a group of civic hackers that had developed a <a href="http://chicagolobbyists.org/">lobbyist application</a> using open data released from the City of Chicago.</p>
<p>This submission drew praise from Chicago CTO John Tolva, who wrote about it on <a href="http://www.ascentstage.com/archives/2012/01/open-data-in-chicago/">his personal blog</a>. The group that put the RFP response together also <a href="http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/2011/12/15/our-response-to-chicagos-lobbyist-rfp/">shared some candid thoughts on their experience</a> with the process and public procurement in general in the City of Chicago.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Responding to an RFP for the City of Chicago is a herculean task… this approach to an RFP results in proposals from one type of contractor: firms that are very large and able to jump through all the hoops that the City has to ensure the minimum amount of risk and liability for the City itself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Following this submission, the group behind Chicago Lobbyist formed a new civic startup &#8211; <a href="http://opencityapps.org/">Open City</a> &#8211; a company focused on building civic apps with open government data.  The company has developed four open data apps to date, including the Chicago Lobbyist application and an enhancement of the city&#8217;s snow plower tracker application called <a href="http://derekeder.com/clearstreets/about.html">Clear Streets</a>.</p>
<p>As enthusiastic as the City of Chicago is about open government data and encouraging civic startups, and despite the abundance of smart developers in the city that want to build civic apps, the city&#8217;s procurement system is not currently set up with civic startups in mind.</p>
<p>A fairly good indicator of this came not long ago in the form of a rejection letter &#8211; the City of Chicago <a href="http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/2012/01/12/chicago-aint-ready-for-procurement-reform/">rejected the bid</a> from the group behind Chicago Lobbyist to build an official online lobbyist registration app for the city.  </p>
<p>Just how out of line the city&#8217;s procurement system is with civic startups is nicely captured by <a href="http://blog.chicagolobbyists.org/2012/01/12/chicago-aint-ready-for-procurement-reform/">the group&#8217;s reaction</a> to the rejection letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We were almost certainly rejected because we did not fulfill the application requirements set out by the Department of Procurement Services. We never intended to. Despite being very competent technologists and experts on lobbying data, we simply couldn’t meet them: The city’s requirements are not crafted with tech startups in mind.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time a talented group of technologists dedicated to improving how governments use technology has tried to &#8220;storm the castle walls&#8221; through the procurement process.  A <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/cjoh">Clay Johnson</a> led Sunlight Labs <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/we-are-going-bid-recoverygov/">tried it a few years ago</a> when they put together a bid to build the federal <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Recovery.gov</a> site.</p>
<p>But it is an important reminder of just how large the gulf is between the world of open data apps and civic startups, and the world of government contracts and purchasing.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that the group behind Chicago Lobbyist should have automatically been granted the contract to build an online lobbyist registration system &#8211; though their past work in this area would seem to have warranted more than just a form letter from the city&#8217;s procurement officer.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think civic startups should be given a free pass.</p>
<p>Government procurement rules exist for a reason. They help mitigate the risk that governments &#8211; and by extension, taxpayers &#8211; assume when they enter into a contract with a company for a good or service.  The government has an interest in ensuring that such companies will be able to provide the good or service at quality, and that the firm will remain viable through the life of the contract.</p>
<p>Government procurement rules also exist to ensure that government spending is done without regard to political (or other) connections.  They are meant to provide transparency and predictability to those that participate in the procurement process.</p>
<p>But, as the group behind Chicago Lobbyist can attest to, these rules often prove challenging to small startup companies rich in talent but lacking the skills needed to navigate municipal bureaucracy. </p>
<p>The sheer magnitude of government spending on IT goods and services is often pointed to as one of the key factors underscoring the potential for civic startups.  But this potential won&#8217;t be realized unless governments find a way to accommodate civic startups within existing procurement systems, or unless they build new ones.</p>
<p>2012 has begun with <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2012-01-06/business/30600906_1_code-accelerator-online-tools">a lot of attention being paid to civic startups</a>, and the potential for startups to incite change within government.  But without a plan to drive meaningful procurement reform in cities and states, it&#8217;s legitimate to ask how far reaching this change will ultimately be.</p>
<p>Sooner or later someone in government is going to have to assume some risk.  </p>
<p>Governments will need to find a way to make a bet on small, agile companies with a demonstrated history of good work like Open City, or they will need to take on the task of reforming their procurement and purchasing systems.  Either way, there is risk involved.</p>
<p>The fact that this all seems to be unfolding in Chicago, where municipal leaders have embraced open data with gusto, is intriguing.  </p>
<p>Chicago seems to have raced to the front of the pack among cities hoping to use open government data to drive change. They have an <a href="http://data.cityofchicago.org/">open data portal</a> full of useful data sets, and are fresh off a successful and highly regarded <a href="http://appsformetrochicago.com/">civic app contest</a>.  </p>
<p>In relatively short order they have made it to the same plateau where many cities supporting open data find themselves &#8211; looking for a way to foster the growth of sustainable apps and companies built on open data.</p>
<p>As more cities make their way to this same place, there will be a collective realization that to take things further will require some fundamental changes to the way that governments purchase IT services.  </p>
<p>2012 could be the “Year of the Civic Startup,” or it could be the year of missed opportunities. The success of governments in finding ways for their procurement systems to work for companies like Open City will largely determine the direction we&#8217;ll take in the months ahead. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/06/five-things-governments-can-do-to-encourage-civic-startups/">last post</a>, I made reference to some of the qualities of civic startups &#8211; the special and important things about these kinds of small, agile companies that set them apart from other startups.</p>
<p>I think clarifying what civic startups are (and what they are not), as well as what we expect them to achieve is important.  </p>
<p>Let me be clear, I have great respect for anyone who creates a startup. I have many friends in the technology community who either have, are or will work for a startup company. I do not mean to suggest that civic startups are, generally speaking, &#8220;better&#8221; than other kinds of startups.</p>
<p>What I mean to emphasize is that civic startups have particular qualities that make them attractive to both governments and citizens. Both parties have an interest in seeing these kinds of startups succeed because both will realize benefits when they do.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p><span id="more-41"></span></p>
<p>Civic startups are those companies that, through the pursuit of their core missions, produce what economists call a positive externality. In other words, there are benefits inherent in the services these companies provide that are not reflected in the cost of that service.</p>
<p>This is fairly easy to see when we look at companies like <a href="http://turbovote.org/">TurboVote</a> and <a href="http://electnext.com/">ElectNext</a>, or <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/">SeeClickFix</a> and <a href="http://www.citysourced.com/default.aspx">CitySourced</a>.  Everyone benefits when voters are more engaged and participate more regularly in elections, or when city neighborhoods are cleaned up. </p>
<p>When people use the services of these startups, other people that are not users reap a benefit.  This is exactly the kind of company that governments at all levels should be working to encourage.</p>
<p>Civic startups are also those companies that use government data to take on a role previously fulfilled by governments themselves (or by contractors hired by governments).  This is most easily seen in the development of customer, or citizen-facing software applications.</p>
<p>In the roughly 15 or so years since the Internet became a viable channel through which to provide government service, it was governments themselves that built most of the citizen-facing applications.  With the release of open government data and support for programmable interfaces like <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>, we are witnessing an increasing amount of this work being done by independent parties outside of government (and outside of traditional government contract vehicles).</p>
<p>More and more applications that people are using to interact with their governments and consume government services are being built at weekend hackathons, or by startups that want to leverage open data to provide a useful service. Think of applications like <a href="http://youtown.com/">YouTown</a>, that are built on open government data and that provide new ways for people to interact with their governments.  </p>
<p>Instead of governments building these apps directly, or &#8211; by extension &#8211; through a contract with an existing company, governments are increasingly becoming &#8220;data stewards&#8221; responsible for providing the raw materials for building useful civic applications.  This is a major paradigm shift for governments, and civic startups will play a critical role in it.</p>
<p>Governments have traditionally faced limitations in hiring and maintaining top IT talent, and the pace of innovation in software development moves at a rate much different than that of the traditional government procurement process. By embracing open data and APIs, governments are opening the door to smart, civicly-minded, business savvy individuals to fill the void with the latest technologies.</p>
<p>In the case of civic startups built around <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">transit applications</a>, we see both of these qualities of civic startups in evidence.  Transit-focused civic apps are built on data collected and maintained by transit agencies, and by encouraging more transit ridership they generate a benefit even for non-users (less traffic, less pollution from automobiles).</p>
<p>Understanding what civic startups are is important.  Because there are real benefits to be gained from the success of civic startups, governments would seem to have a built in motivation to help them succeed.  To the extent that these startups are easily recognizable, governments will be much more likely to do so.</p>
<p>Having a clear definition of what civic startups are will also help us evaluate their success, and the success of efforts to support them and help them grow. </p>
