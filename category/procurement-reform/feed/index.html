<p>When we think about all of the work being done in the civic technology and open government communities over the last several years, it&#8217;s easy to see the impact.</p>
<p>Evaluated just in terms of the number of datasets that have been released by governments it is clear that the impact of those advocating for more open, responsive and agile government has been significant. But those working in these communities have far more to show for their efforts. One of the most under appreciated (at least in my opinion) is advice: <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/11/30/a-new-approach-to-procuring-government-technology-in-california/">solid guidance and recommendations</a> for how to make things better.</p>
<p>Consider all of the work being done to provide recommendations for governments to <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/@centerforgov">use technology more efficiently</a> and to become <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/">more open and transparent</a>. There are countless examples where individuals that have developed expertise over many years of working to improve how governments use technology and data share their learnings and recommendations freely and openly. We don&#8217;t have a shortage of good ideas for governments to use to start making changes to how they use technology to build services and engage citizens.</p>
<p>But I think there is a legitimate questions as to whether enough governments are using these recommendations, or they&#8217;re not using them quickly or effectively enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time lately wondering why.</p>
<p><span id="more-3902"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe the problem is that there is too little information for governments to act on to make positive changes. Rather, I&#8217;m starting to think that much of this information is not in a format that is actionable by those in government who will need to make these changes. What seems to be missing are recommendations that are formatted for immediate action by legislators and other officials &#8211; policies that can be adopted by governments to become more open and more agile that require no assembly.</p>
<p>If we look around for blueprints for how this &#8220;no assembly required&#8221; approach to civic innovation could work, there are some examples of this concept at work.</p>
<p>One example is the body of municipal codes that govern the various aspects of building construction &#8211; building codes, electrical codes, plumbing codes, etc. If you look at the statutes of many local governments for the rules governing construction, you&#8217;ll probably see reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Building_Code">International Building Code</a>. This model code has been developed by the <a href="http://www.iccsafe.org/">International Code Council</a> and adopted by jurisdictions across the county. These governments prefer to leverage the policy expertise of a central standard body rather than develop their own in-house expertise &#8211; an issue that can be particularly acute for smaller governments who may lack resources. The model code developed by the standard body becomes the law of the jurisdiction where it is adopted.</p>
<p>Another example is the Institute for Public Procurement (NIGP) &#8211; a trade group representing government procurement officers &#8211; which has developed a <a href="http://www.nigp.org/eweb/StartPage.aspx?Site=NIGP&amp;webcode=cps_ps_nc">uniform set of codes governing asset classification</a> that has been adopted by over 1,400 separate governments. These jurisdictions have opted to use the classification system developed by the NIGP rather than invest the time and expense of acquiring the expertise to develop and maintain their own classification systems.</p>
<p>These may seem like esoteric examples &#8211; I&#8217;m sure there are many others &#8211; but they share some common elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing appropriate language to implement a policy requires specialized expertise or experience.</li>
<li>The jurisdiction implementing the policy may have limited resources or lack in-house expertise in the specific policy area.</li>
<li>The activity to be governed by the policy is common to other jurisdictions &#8211; there is nothing inherently unique or special about the activity for any one particular government.</li>
<li>A standard body or professional group develops a set of policy guidelines that are immediately adoptable by a jurisdiction with little or no modifications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating model laws and policies for governments to adopt is not a new idea. This is something that groups like the <a href="http://www.alec.org/">American Legislative Exchange Council</a> (ALEC) have been doing for years. Many people would argue they&#8217;ve been pretty successful with this approach &#8211; perhaps <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/08/13/how-states-plagiarize-interest-group-model-bills-on-many-issues/">too successful</a>.</p>
<p>But it begs the question &#8211; is it possible to develop model policies that can institutionalize the principles being developed in the open government and civic technology communities? If so, why isn’t there an ALEC-like group creating model IT procurement legislation or model transparency legislation for state and local governments?</p>
<p>Over the past year or so, there has been a notable change in thinking about the proper approach to developing successful digital services and civic technology solutions with an <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play1">enhanced focus on the user</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe its time for the civic technology community to more directly tailor its policy recommendations and advice for those in government that need to adopt them.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://civic.io/2015/06/26/govtech-is-not-broken/">another recent post</a>, I talked about how public sector technology procurement was not well suited for the digital age.</p>
<p>But there are some efforts underway that seek to identify new methods of procuring technology solutions for government. As these ideas start to take hold, there is hope that those in the govtech community will create a set of strategies for more successfully implementing public sector technology solutions.</p>
<h4>Built to fail?</h4>
<p>The design of procurement policies that are used by our federal, state, and local governments are meant to encourage broad participation by requiring things like public announcements of solicitations, open vendor meetings, and fixed deadlines for submitting responses. The hope is to make the process as predictable and transparent as possible, and to level the playing field so that any qualified vendor can participate.</p>
<p>Procurement policies are also designed to mitigate risk and to ensure that selected vendors are competent and capable of undertaking the work required in government IT projects. It is important that these policies be consistent with the government’s duty to be responsible stewards of public resources.</p>
<p>In light of this, there is a great irony in the outcomes that these policies often seem to produce.</p>
<p><span id="more-4661"></span></p>
<p>Participation in government IT projects tends to be constrained to a subset of larger firms that regularly compete for contracts, while smaller, more nimble firms get squeezed out. In addition, the mechanisms meant to mitigate risk in government IT projects all too often seem to miss the mark in preventing technology projects from being delayed, <a class="external" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value" target="_blank">going over budget</a>, or failing altogether.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a need to redesign government IT procurement policies to more frequently produce the outcomes we desire.</p>
<p>In order to do this, government officials will be faced with some hard choices.</p>
<h4>Time is of the essence</h4>
<p>One of the most common complaints about the current technology procurement process is simply that it “takes too long.” Interestingly, you can hear this complaint from both government officials and vendors.</p>
<p>The length of time it takes for the procurement process to finish is a particularly acute one for technology projects. Smaller firms which may be proficient in the latest platforms and development methodologies can get squeezed out simply because they do not have the resources or the institutional endurance to go through the process.</p>
<p>In addition, the technology landscape can change quickly with new ways of building powerful solutions emerging every day. Governments are often saddled with obsolete technology and long procurement cycles can exacerbate this problem.</p>
<p>Why does the public procurement process seem to take so long?</p>
<p>If we look closely, we can see that the specific design elements that have been engineered into the technology procurement process to support the goals of transparency and risk mitigation are almost always time intensive.</p>
<p>An abbreviated solicitation may mean less time to get the word out to prospective bidders, or complaints that not everyone was aware of a specific procurement opportunity. Utilizing a fixed schedule for vendor meetings, responding to questions about a solicitation, reviewing bids, and announcing a selected firm can sometimes take months.</p>
<p>Even after an award has been made, the process can take several months before work actually begins. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia—where I once worked—for technology projects, the period between a contract award (when a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of a contract (the beginning of actual work on the project) takes an average of four months.</p>
<p>This period of time is often used to review terms and conditions, legal stipulations, critical milestones and other issues that will govern the project as work gets done—all of which are meant to insulate the government from unforeseen risk.</p>
<p>So if time is the essential ingredient used to ensure that the procurement process is open and transparent, and also the primary tool used to ensure risk mitigation for governments then procurement reformers have some tough decisions to make. Reformers—and government officials—must either be willing to accept less openness and transparency (or, at least, the perception of it) and more risk for governments to expedite procurement cycles.</p>
<p>These don’t seem like the kind of tradeoffs that will be palatable to policy makers. We need new techniques for promoting openness and diminishing risk in the technology procurement process.</p>
<h4>DESIGNING NEW STRATEGIES</h4>
<p>One of the entities developing new techniques for mitigating risk in the technology procurement process is<a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a>.</p>
<p>18F is a <a class="external" href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/04/22/the-difference-between-18f-and-usds/" target="_blank">new group</a> formed in the wake of the Presidential Innovation Fellow program within the General Services Administration (GSA). The organization, which focuses on bringing 21st Century digital practices to the federal agencies, takes its name from the location of GSA’s offices in Washington D.C.,at the corner of 18th Street and F Street.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, 18F <a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/01/08/creating-a-federal-marketplace-for-agile-delivery-services/" target="_blank">began work on a new process</a> for agile technology services for federal agencies. Interestingly, in developing this new approach the group zeroed in on the time component of the procurement process and articulated how this can often be a detriment to efficient technology acquisitions:</p>
<blockquote><p>The reality is that business priorities, user needs, and technologies evolve and emerge on a continual basis. To keep pace, software acquisitions need to move at the speed of <b>agile </b>development cycles. Ideally, this means less than four weeks from solicitation to contract kickoff, and from there no more than three months to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP).</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the more interesting aspects of this new approach from 18F is that it employs a new technique to help mitigate risk. Participating vendors are <a class="external" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/06/15/agile-bpa-is-here/" target="_blank">required to show their work</a> in advance to demonstrate competency:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re requiring vendors to submit a working prototype based on a public dataset and show their work in a publicly available git repository. We’re also requiring ourselves to adopt a rigorous evaluation methodology to ensure that the vendors can meet our needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This approach is similar to one that was <a class="external" href="https://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/" target="_blank">tested by the City of Philadelphia in 2013</a>, and it’s easy to see how it could be a much more effective way to mitigate risk in government technology projects. Requiring prospective vendors to submit an example of their work in a public git repository promotes transparency and provides and an advance view of the quality of their work. In addition, it can help ensure alignment with the agile principles that 18F is trying to implement.</p>
<p>Some have criticized this approach because—for now—it is only available to vendors that are already on the federal <a class="external" href="http://gsa.gov/portal/content/104506" target="_blank">Schedule 70 for IT services</a>, and does not expand the universe of potential vendors to include firms that ordinarily might be shut out of the process. But I think this is exactly the kind of approach that is needed to redesign the way that governments procure technology services and solutions. The process of change has to begin somewhere, and as a first step 18F’s <a class="external" href="https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/assets/ADS_RFQ_Final.pdf" target="_blank">Agile Delivery BPA</a> is impressive.</p>
<p>Though a relatively new organization, it’s worth noting that some have been <a class="external" href="http://www.meritalk.com/blog.php?user=SteveOKeeffe&amp;blogentry_id=3971" target="_blank">more broadly critical of the efforts of 18F</a> and have questioned the organization’s potential for lasting impact. Most of this criticism tends to focus on a lack of tangible projects that the group—as yet—can point to as indicators of change to the way that federal agencies deploy technology solutions.</p>
<p>But as important as individual projects that can be listed in a press release are, it is equally important that this group—and <a class="external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service" target="_blank">others</a> working within the federal government—change the culture and processes that have for so long hindered the way that agencies use technology.</p>
<p>If the Agile Delivery BPA is any indication, 18F is an organization that will have a fundamental and long-term impact on how the federal government does business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its not often that I run across posts about enterprise architecture that get me excited. <a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7">This one</a> &#8211; by <a href="https://twitter.com/postenterprise">Tariq Rashid</a> &#8211; did. Very much so.</p>
<p>This issue interests me because its one that, as a former state IT executive and policy advisor, I have personal history with. I also believe its an issue that will have great impact on how successful governments are at redesigning services around users, and embracing civic technology and open data.</p>
<p><span id="more-3728"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7">The post</a> presents a novel and compelling view of what an enterprise architecture can be by preaching against one of the central tenants of most enterprise architecture documents &#8211; mandated reuse of IT components:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reuse of a vaguely similar functions is encouraged or even mandated. These strategies go further and propose the pre-emptive building of big platforms for future reuse. The problem is, this kind of reuse is <strong>wrong and damaging</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, many enterprise architecture planning efforts are born out of a perceived need to prevent expensive (and possibly wasteful) investment in disparate IT platforms and systems. Asserting that reuse is bad in this context can be viewed by some as radical &#8211; almost heretical &#8211; thinking.</p>
<p><strong>What is Enterprise Architecture?</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of detailed discussions about enterprise architecture with others in the civic technology community, but the issue is implicit in many of the discussions that open data and civic hacking advocates have.</p>
<p>Why do governments implement technology they way they do? What was the decision process that led to investment in a specific technology or acquisition of a specific system? How is the overall vision for technology investment and management by a government developed, and by who?</p>
<p>Every civic hacker has pondered these questions from time to time.</p>
<p>Before we go too deeply into this issue, it helps to have an understanding of what enterprise architecture is from the perspective of a government IT organization. Ideally, an Enterprise Architecture (EA) Plan &#8211; developed, not surprisingly, by an Enterprise Architect &#8211; will provide a series of recommendations that can help an organization invest wisely in technology. It should present a coherent vision for IT planning and investment that will guide an organization into the future. Good EA plans help enable the efficient adoption of valuable IT solutions by an organization, and help mitigate the negative impacts of potentially disruptive changes in technology the organization may face in the future.</p>
<p>In practice, many government EA plans are a set of rules that agencies are expected to abide by. Many agency IT staff view Enterprise Architects as hopelessly out of touch with the realities of implementing systems meant to provide front-line services to the public. (The words &#8220;Ivory Tower&#8221; and &#8220;Enterprise Architect&#8221; are often muttered closely together in front-line agency circles.) Many EA plans are out of date, in a perpetual state of being updated and are viewed with some level of derision by agency IT personnel and outside IT vendors.</p>
<p><strong>An Enterprise History</strong></p>
<p>My own, admittedly limited, experience with helping to craft an EA plan stems from my time as a chief advisor to the CIO for the State of Delaware. I was tasked with helping to implement the Governor&#8217;s vision for e-government (that&#8217;s what we were calling it in those days), which involved work to provide Internet-based access to government information and services. This was a <a href="http://www.govtech.com/featured/Delawares-Dynamic-Minner.html">key objective of the Governor</a> and an enormous amount of emphasis was placed on moving state services online.</p>
<p>One of the most acute challenges we faced was that some agencies had already started to implement online services before an overarching plan was in place &#8211; investing in new solutions to move services to the web, or engaging vendors to build new online applications. Because some of this activity had happened in the absence of a coherent strategy from the central IT organization (where I worked) there was concern that agencies would invest in very different technologies to do things that had significant overlap (e.g., identity management, payment processing, etc.). There was additional concern that at some point these different solutions would become the responsibility of the central IT agency to take care of.</p>
<p><a href="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/title-slide.jpg"><img style="float:right;padding:5px;" src="https://civicio.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/title-slide.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="title-slide" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>In every government that I have worked for, people invariably tell stories of how agencies with political clout or dedicated funding sources acquire a new (usually non-standard) technology that gets implemented, gains usage or traction with stakeholders and then gets foisted onto the central IT agency for long-term maintenance and upkeep. As a result, most central IT agencies view an EA plan as a way to reign in &#8220;those rouge agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way, I took this view as well when I made recommendations for a set of common components to be used for all agency e-government projects. I argued that if we could identify a core set of components that could be used over and over again as new projects got rolled out to the public we would reduce complexity and save money. Included in this post is a shot of the title slide from a presentation I made to state leaders on this subject in 2003 (I&#8217;ve had this presentation in a file in my office all these years).</p>
<p><strong>Prescriptive vs. Enabling Architectures</strong></p>
<p>When I think about how I would design an enterprise architecture today, I think I would make it look and work a lot like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>. What I love about Heroku is that it is designed to enable the efficient deployment of apps &#8211; you build and deploy things in a way that feels easy and makes sense because the platform is engineered to support it. It enables desired behavior instead of outlawing undesired behavior. If you want to roll your own app monitoring or logging (or whatever else you need for your app) you can do that, but the cost and complexity of your bespoke approach are on you. Alternatively, you can quickly and easily leverage one of the <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/">preexisting add-ons</a> to support your application and Heroku takes care of the hard stuff for you.</p>
<p>This kind of &#8220;enabling&#8221; architecture stands in stark contrast to the &#8220;prescriptive,&#8221; rule-based architectures we see so often in government. Looking back on my old e-government presentation with almost 12 years of additional experience, it&#8217;s easy to see the flaws in my approach, and the logic in the recommendations <a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7">here</a>. I think most people with any exposure to enterprise architecture would immediately see the benefits of what the author is saying, but then why do most EA plans not look like what the author is describing?</p>
<p>I think there are specific reasons why most EA plans look very different than the vision presented <a href="https://medium.com/@postenterprise/the-abuse-of-reuse-96b2e0af01a7">here</a>. I also think that if we&#8217;re going to get closer to that vision &#8211; or another one that provides similar benefits &#8211; then we need to understand the reasons for these differences.</p>
<p><strong>Accounting for Differences</strong></p>
<p>There is an interesting discussion in Rashid&#8217;s post about &#8220;developing with minimal commitment&#8221; and &#8220;avoiding sticky contracts,&#8221; and while I agree that doing those things would make for more sensible enabling architecture plans (and better IT implementation) the problem I see is that most government procurement processes don&#8217;t work this way at all. The procurement process is long, complex and costly &#8211; for both vendors and governments &#8211; so it promotes stickiness, if for no other reason than to try and provide a return on the investment in the process itself. This design is <a href="https://civic.io/2013/12/27/three-hard-truths-for-government-procurement-reform/">not accidental</a>, and there are no easy routes to changing it.</p>
<p>Prescriptive architectures filled with <strong>dos</strong> and <strong>don&#8217;ts</strong> for agencies are usually a product of big up front investment in technology platforms and systems. If a state or local government has preemptively invested in a system then there are strong incentives for the adoption of requirements that agencies use this systems (to justify to cost of investment).</p>
<p>IT planning and spending &#8211; like everything else in state or local government &#8211; are a function of the budget process. Planning, adoption, executing and auditing of government expenditures is a multiyear process that (generally speaking) is <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">a lousy fit</a> for the way that we use and consume technology today. &#8220;Easy-on-easy-off pay-as-you-go&#8221; expenditures are not easily engineered into this process. The current budget process used by almost every state and local government is engineered to support larger, up front expenditures for technology which tend to favor prescriptive architectures filled with rules about what agencies can use (the stuff that&#8217;s already been bought and paid for) and what they can&#8217;t (everything else).</p>
<p>The public budgeting process generally discourages smaller, iterative funding approaches to IT projects. From a pure self interest standpoint, there are strong incentives pushing project advocates to get as much funding allocated for their project as possible, lest their request get crowded out by competing initiatives. Better to get the biggest allocation possible and, ideally, get it encumbered so that there are assurances it is there if things get tight in the next budget cycle.</p>
<p>In addition, There are a number of actors in the budget process at all levels of government (i.e., legislators) who equate the size of a budget allocation for a project with its importance. This can provide another strong incentive for project advocates to think big &#8211; in many cities and states, funding for IT projects is going to compete with things like funding for schools, pension funding, tax relief and a bunch of other stuff that&#8217;s probably going to resonate with some pretty vocal constituencies. This can put a lot of pressure on project advocates to push for as much funding as they can. There&#8217;s just too much uncertainty about what will happen in the next budget cycle.</p>
<p>This tends to result in the pre-emptive building of big platforms (those for which funding is obtained during the budget process) for future reuse, and the adoption of prescriptive architectures to ensure agencies use them.</p>
<p>An Enterprise Architecture that supports smart investment in technology is critical for governments to reap all of the benefits of service redesign, open data and civic innovation . But the reason that most governments rely on overly prescriptive EA plans and large upfront investment in (ostensibly) reusable components is because state and local government procurement and budgeting processes favor them.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re going to craft EA plans to support innovation, we have to find ways to <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">reengineer these fundamental processes</a> of government first.</p>

This one incident almost perfectly... <div class="excerpt-more"><a class="read-more" href="https://civic.io/2015/01/31/pursuing-change-by-finding-balance/">Read More <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i></a></div>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/01/26/faa-drones/22342517/">recent crash</a> of a quadcopter drone on the grounds of the White House has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/10/7370955/the-faas-drone-regulations-wont-be-ready-until-at-least-2017">drawn attention</a> to the absence of final rules from the FAA governing unmanned aircraft &#8211; rules that have now been in the works for years.</p>
<p>This one incident almost perfectly encapsulates the difficulty that governments have with keeping pace with changes in technology. Technology can change in a matter of months or even weeks, quickly making it <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Parrot-Drone-Quadricopter-Edition-Orange/dp/B007HZLLOK">easy and affordable</a> for almost anyone to buy a drone. The <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">process that the government uses</a> to adopt new rules and regulations, that can govern how these newly affordable drones may be used, can take years to become final.</p>
<p><span id="more-3660"></span></p>
<p>The problem here seems obvious &#8211; how can governments hope to keep pace with changes in technology when the processes they use to do their jobs regularly take many months or even years? And this problem is not reserved to how agencies craft and implement new regulations that govern how citizens and businesses use new technologies &#8211; it extends to how governments use new technologies themselves.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">post I wrote last year</a>, I argued that the processes governments use to budget for and buy technology, and to hire employees into IT positions are &#8220;built to fail.&#8221; Can we make this same criticism of the process by which new federal rules are adopted?</p>
<p><strong>Built to Fail</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The processes that support paying for and acquiring technology, and the process for hiring IT workers are designed in a way that make them a bad match for the dynamics of the technology industry.&#8221;<br />
&#8212; <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">Built to Fail</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The thing that critics of the government procurement process (and other processes used by government to acquire and use technology) often fail to appreciate is that the system largely works as designed.</p>
<p>Governments imbue the procurement process with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.</p>
<p>For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.</p>
<p>There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.</p>
<p>Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.</p>
<p>These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to make the same criticism of the federal rule making process &#8211; the process is designed to be as open, inclusive and deliberative as possible. It also includes a <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/reginfo/Regmap/regmap_analyses.jsp">number of different steps</a> to ensure that specific policy objectives are being met. And while I don&#8217;t think most people would argue with the desirability of the outcomes each of these additional steps seeks to ensure, it makes the process longer and more complex.</p>
<p><strong>A Question a Balance</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rushing the regulatory process can result in rules that are burdensome or unfriendly to innovation. &#8221;<br />
&#8212; Nick Sinai, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/sandboxing-and-smart-regulation-in-an-age-of-ab-testing/">Sandboxing And Smart Regulation</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly there is a need for change &#8211; but how do we ensure speedier outcomes without sacrificing the ideals and objectives that have intentionally been made a part of government processes?</p>
<p>The future of how government regulates technology &#8211; and the future of how it makes use of technology itself &#8211; will depend on how well we can strike a balance between the need for speedier action by government and the ideals and outcomes we imbue into government processes &#8211; most importantly to ensure that they are open, inclusive, fair and deliberative.</p>
<p>Nick Sinai &#8211; former U.S. Deputy CTO at the White House &#8211; offers <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/sandboxing-and-smart-regulation-in-an-age-of-ab-testing/">some great insights</a> into how the federal government could improve the rule making process to make it more responsive to changes in technology. There are also some <a href="http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/onward/61769-npr-highlights-philadelphia-as-a-city-where-tech-procurement-works">interesting experiments</a> happening in cities with changing the process for procuring technology.</p>
<p>But right now, it still feels like were nibbling at the edges of real change. I don&#8217;t think enough people in the civic technology space fully appreciate the deliberate nature of the design of the processes that are failing governments so badly right now. These processes largely aren&#8217;t broken &#8211; they were just designed in a way that typically makes them a bad fit for the pace at which technology changes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how we fix this, but I don&#8217;t think we will unless we acknowledge that some sort of balance needs to be struck. Enabling speedier, more efficient outcomes can&#8217;t come at the cost of openness and fairness in these important government processes.</p>

<p>The Seattle Police Department recently held a <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/seattle-police-hackathon-2014-tickets-14818202643">hackathon</a>.</p>
<p>When the event was initially announced, there was a fair bit of skepticism in the civic technology community with more than a few people stating that the event would likely not be a productive one, for either the Seattle Police or those that chose to attend. I was one of those skeptics &#8211; I thought the event was too narrowly focused and that the problem that attendees would be working to help resolve wouldn&#8217;t appeal to a broad enough audience for it to work as the organizers probably hoped.</p>
<p><span id="more-3606"></span></p>
<p>As it turns out, something rather unexpected happened at the event. Here is what one attendee &#8211; who reported this on a mailing list I am on &#8211; described happening at the event.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It was definitely not a hackathon, but more like an IRL improv RFI. A number of presentations were given by companies, private citizens, and students to show off video processing algorithms and audio transcription services. Each presentation was followed by candid questions from people from the police department, city attorney&#8217;s office, and public servants from jurisdictions throughout the region.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When I read this, it reminded me of another event that was billed as a hackathon but which was actually a hack to the traditional RFI process &#8211; the <a href="http://home2.nyc.gov/html/digital/html/opengov/reinventnycgov.shtml">Reinvent NYC.gov</a> event that was held in New York City prior to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rachel-sterne/8-lessons-from-reinventin_b_4101948.html">overhaul of the city&#8217;s central web porta</a>l.</p>
<p>The goal of the event was to develop prototypes and mockups of a revamped NYC.gov using input and ideas from the technology community. The ideas and insights surfaced at the event were eventually incorporated into the RFP the city issued to overhaul NYC.gov. I&#8217;ve always thought this was a brilliant way to approach a big, complex and costly government RFP &#8211; start with a process that looks much like a hackathon where new approaches and designs are tested and demoed by building actual prototypes.</p>
<p>Given how much <a href="https://civic.io/2013/06/06/the-case-for-making-procurement-harder/">cutting and pasting actually goes into government technology RFPs</a>, I think it would be refreshing to see this kind of approach used more often. It&#8217;s frighteningly common for technology RFPs to be issued by governments where those crafting the RFP have very little idea of the technology options available to solve the problem at hand or enough first hand knowledge to competently evaluate responses.</p>
<p>Maybe another option that the government and civic technology communities should be looking at for improving the public procurement process is what happened in NYC and Seattle.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to be thinking more about ways to turn RFIs into hackathons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;Civic Hacking&#8221; is the awareness of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place and the perception of one’s own ability to effect change on that condition. The apps are incidental.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2008, civic hacking was the furthest thing from my mind.</p>
<p><span id="more-3502"></span></p>
<p>At the time, I was working for a small company in Southwestern Virginia that built payment and telephony systems for local governments. I had left state government behind 5 years prior &#8211; after working for almost a dozen years in two different states in both the legislative and executive branches &#8211; to become a full time technologist. My job enabled me to expand my knowledge of software development, VoIP and telephony systems design and made me feel “connected” to government.</p>
<p>I felt like I was still working to help governments use technology more efficiently &#8211; which was <a href="http://voiceingov.org/">the focus</a> of the last several years of my public service &#8211; because my company was building tools that were used by governments. In reality, I was probably more unsatisfied with my current “connection” with government than I had realized.</p>
<p>In the Fall of that year I came across <a href="http://istrategylabs.com/work/apps-for-democracy-contest/">an announcement about a contest</a> that was taking place in the District of Columbia that seemed quite extraordinary to me. The DC government had published dozens of data sets to a public website in highly usable formats and was inviting outside software developers to do interesting things with this data. Winners would be chosen and given cash rewards, along with a chance to be singled out by the Mayor at a public ceremony.</p>
<p>I instantly knew that I wanted to participate &#8211; even though I neither lived nor worked in DC. I entered the contest, submitted <a href="http://voiceingov.org/2008/10/30/dc-crime-finder/">my application</a>, won the silver medal in the “independent developer” category and got a $1,000 check for my efforts.</p>
<p>For this, and many other reasons, I have been bullish on civic hacking ever since.</p>
<h3>From App Contests to Civic Hacking</h3>
<blockquote><p>“Ultimately, apps contests are having a positive long-term economic impact, regardless of whether they deliver useful technology. They have catalyzed a community of technologists inside and outside of government who are committed to improving the lives of residents and visitors.”</p>
<p>&#8212; Anthony Townsend, <a href="http://www.smartcitiesbook.com/">Smart Cities</a></p></blockquote>
<p>After the initial wave of government app contest spurred by the Apps for Democracy contest in DC, the world of civic hacking <a href="http://govfresh.com/2011/12/philadelphia-open-government-2011-year-in-review/">went grassroots</a>, with community sponsored events popping up all over the country. The last several years have seen the creation and spectacular growth of the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which has helped to create civic hacking groups in dozens of cities in the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>Today, a great deal of civic hacking occurs outside of app contests, or even hackathons themselves. It is a regular activity that occurs each week or month in Code for America Brigades and other groups. A <a href="https://civic.io/2014/07/22/the-hacker-ethos-and-better-cities/">great example that I like to point to</a> is the Detroit Water Project, which came together when the co-creators connected via Twitter. The <a href="http://detroitwaterproject.org/">project</a> didn&#8217;t require a hackathon or similar event, or even a physical meeting between the creators to get started.</p>

<p>App contests and the early wave of organized civic hacking events has helped spur the development of a large (and growing) community that can now come together and interact more fluidly. The solutions being developed by these groups are increasingly potent and I think are appropriately viewed as part of the answer to the problems governments face in using technology to do their jobs.</p>
<h3>The Three-Legged Stool</h3>
<p>Of the many different policy options put forward in the last few years aimed at improving the way governments implement technology, I think there are three primary themes we can identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reform the <a href="https://civic.io/2013/12/27/three-hard-truths-for-government-procurement-reform/">government procurement process</a> (as it relates to IT acquisitions).</li>
<li>Build up the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/index.html">internal capacity of government</a> to better manage IT projects (particularly large scale projects).</li>
<li>Deploy APIs and release open data to create a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYB8xokkWjg">platform</a> on which third parties may develop new applications and services (&#8220;government as a platform&#8221;).</li>
</ul>
<p>To solve the overarching problem, I think each of these three approaches are needed to some degree &#8211; a balance between them must be struck so that they act like the metaphorical &#8220;three-legged stool.&#8221; Of these three remedies, the one that requires the most radical perceived departure from the way that governments currently operate is the third &#8211; turning government into a platform.</p>
<p>Certainly the scope to which the current procurement process must be changed is vast, and governments have a long way to go to replicate the capacity for successful IT project management that we see in private sector organizations. But progress on these fronts involves changes &#8211; as dramatic as they may need to be &#8211; to existing processes, not the invention of brand new ones.</p>
<p>The idea of creating government as a platform, and enabling agencies to work collaboratively with outside parties (outside of traditional contract vehicles) to develop applications for their constituencies can seem like the most radical change. It requires governments to abdicate some control to new partners, to develop mechanisms for engaging and collaborating with these partners and to reimagine their role in the IT service delivery chain &#8211; to no longer be the unilateral creator of solutions used by and for government, and to become an enabler that incentivizes others to build them.</p>
<p>Despite the perceived novelty of this approach in the world of technology, there is actually a long history of reliance on outside volunteers to deliver important government services &#8211; one that continues today. In fact, there is a rich spectrum of examples that we can observe in the contemporary operation of government that involves government reliance on outside volunteers to deliver essential public services.</p>
<p>I believe that these examples hold the key to informing how governments should collaborate with outside civic hackers to develop new solutions that can improve the performance of government and the quality of the services they deliver.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction as a Foundation For Action</h3>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuuyJIo4Cds?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>The video above was captured in September 2013 in the UK, and shows a group of people heading home after a night out on the town. The surprising thing about this footage is that it didn&#8217;t capture people behaving badly &#8211; in fact, it shows the group working collaboratively to fix a damaged bike rack.</p>
<p>Distilled to its essence &#8211; this is what civic hacking is. It is the awareness of a condition that is suboptimal in a neighborhood, community or place and the perception of one&#8217;s own ability to effect change on that condition. There is no prerequisite that civic hacking involve technology or software, it only needs to involve people willing to help fix problems &#8211; apps are incidental to the larger goal of fixing a community problem.</p>
<p>In a way, civic hacking is the a manifestation of dissatisfaction with government services. And while there has probably always been some level of dissatisfaction with the performance of government, the spread of open data and powerful, cheap tools for using this data to build new apps allows citizens to design their own interfaces to interactions with their government.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of examples we can point to where outside parties develop solutions on top of government provided or maintained data &#8211; to fill a role or address an issue that would ordinarily fall under the official responsibilities of a government agency. In Philadelphia, there are a number of efforts underway to encourage the <a href="http://www.groundedinphilly.org/">repurposing of vacant properties</a>, even though official responsibility for this falls under the duties assigned to <a href="http://www.phila.gov/pra/about.html">specific government agencies</a>. These outside efforts are enabled by the <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/search/?sort=name&amp;dir=asc&amp;qs=property&amp;filter=data">deliberate release of property information</a> by the City of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Before civic hacking, it was not possible for people to custom tailor an interaction with their government to their liking, or to change that way that government information and services were presented. Now it can be quite easy to do this. This presents an enormous challenge to the bureaucracy, and &#8211; in many ways &#8211; an enormous opportunity.</p>
<h3>An Abundance of Skeptics</h3>
<p>Despite the popularity of hackathons, and the strong growth of civic hacking across the country, it’s not difficult to find people that criticize civic hacking, or question its long-term impact.</p>
<p>In my experience most people that are skeptical of the potential impact of civic hacking have either been to very few (if any) actual civic hacking events, or conflate government sponsored app contests &#8211; that were quite common several years ago &#8211; with the larger civic hacking movement. Some even question the motives of those that promote civic hacking and suggest that it may be nothing more than a sham meant to take advantage of skilled but inexperienced workers in an unfavorable job market.</p>
<p>In an unfortunately misguided <a href="https://www.academia.edu/8728551/Hack_for_good_Speculative_labor_app_development_and_the_burden_of_austerity">analysis of civic hacking</a> (currently in draft form), Melissa Gregg of Intel states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As an enactment of civic intent, hackathons parochialize the ambition of democratic participation to topics that attract the data and technical means for impact in the course of a day or a weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even organizations focused on fostering innovation in cities can be critical of civic hacking. A 2012 &#8220;field scan&#8221; of civic technology for the group <a href="https://www.livingcities.org/">Living Cities</a> said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Energetic, enthusiastic volunteering in ‘hackathons’ and other partnerships are not enough to create sustainable change in cities. Although hackathons are popular, their approach to problem solving is not always driven by community needs, and hackathons often do not produce useful material for governments or citizens in need.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think both of these criticisms fail to see civic hacking as a larger movement that exists outside specific events that happen on a weekend here and there, and both miss the very important point that the apps created at any specific event are often not the primary focus of the hackathon.</p>
<p>In his excellent summary for running a civic hackathon, <a href="https://hackathon.guide/">Joshua Tauberer</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to prepare participants for solving problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>The civic technology community has <a href="https://medium.com/@elle_mccann/the-myth-of-everybody-85e4004be1f6">become increasingly aware</a> of the need to ensure that solutions are developed in collaboration with those that are meant to benefit from them. Civic hacking groups are <a href="http://www.cutgroup.org/">developing new ways</a> to include the users of civic application into the development process, to better ensure that their preferences and viewpoints are considered. In many ways, I think its fair to say that the amount of time and energy currently focused on ensuring user input in the development of civic apps probably outpaces the amount invested in the development of official government apps.</p>
<p>But most of all, what strikes me as relevant in these criticisms of civic hacking is the derision &#8211; whether explicit or implied &#8211; of the <em>volunteer</em> nature of it. I disagree that the volunteer nature of civic hacking means that it does not have value, or that it can not have a long-term impact. In fact, there are a number of examples that we can point to where governments partner with volunteers to provide important public services.</p>
<h3>A Long History of Volunteerism</h3>
<p>Government collaboration with volunteers may be new to the world of technology, but in other areas of public service delivery it is quite common.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_fire_department#United_States">vast majority</a> of firefighters serving the Untied States are volunteers &#8211; 69% according the National Fire Protection Association. So cemented in our national psyche as a symbol of selfless public service are volunteer firefighters that it was used as the template for the Code for America Brigades that are now growing in cities across the country. But there are many other examples where the government collaborates with volunteers to provide important services.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps">AmeriCorps service program</a> &#8211; created under the Clinton Administration &#8211; is a federal program to recruit young adults to service in their community. This program was specifically designed not only to attract volunteers to help deliver important services, but also to facilitate professional growth in volunteers themselves and provide work experience. We can see many of these <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/10/13/want-to-take-your-brigade-to-the-next-level-develop-it/">same objectives playing out</a> in the world of civic hacking, where some communities are introducing a new focus on skill development and technology literacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch">Neighborhood watch</a> groups, <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/programs/adopt-highway">adopt-a-highway</a> programs and <a href="http://www.phila.gov/qualityoflife/communitypartnershipprogram/Pages/EffectiveCleanup.aspx">community cleanup</a> groups are additional examples where volunteers are helping to provide a service that would ordinarily fall to government alone to provide. In the City of Philadelphia, there is <a href="http://www.philadelphiastreets.com/pmbc/block-captain">a formal program to designate citizens</a> who have the support of their neighbors as &#8220;Block Captains&#8221; &#8211; this individuals act as the liaison for a community and interact directly with designated employees within city government. It is worth noting that these Block Captains are given official standing with the city (each is issued an ID card) and provided with support materials and training.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the long history that governments have in collaborating with outside partners that volunteer their time, skills and expertise. But what is interesting to me is that there is very little discussion about the role of civic hacking in this larger picture of volunteerism.</p>
<p>Why does government collaboration with other kinds of volunteer groups seem do differ so much from civic hacking?</p>
<h3>Working Towards More Effective Civic Hacking</h3>
<blockquote><p>We should say to critics in the media or elsewhere that failure is an essential part of government, just as it is in private enterprise. And the cost of failure should be tiny, dwarfed by its rewards&#8230;It’s much better to fail fast, fail cheap, and then put things right at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>&#8212; Mike Bracken, <a href="http://mikebracken.com/blog/on-policy-and-delivery/">On Policy and Delivery</a></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the things that governments face the most challenges in adopting as part of how they build and implement technology is agile development methodologies that employ iteration and failure as tools to develop better products. For a variety of reasons, this approach can be hard for government to adopt.</p>
<p>Civic hacking groups, however, present an enormously valuable potential partner for governments &#8211; they can help develop and test a variety of different solutions outside of the traditional government contracting and procurement processes that can be used to see what works, and (perhaps more importantly) what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s agile development by proxy &#8211; or could be, if governments were able to see the value of stronger relationships with civic hacking groups.</p>
<p>One of the common themes that emerges when we look at the different kinds of volunteer activities that governments rely on to help provide important government services is that they have the official sanction of the government. This point is probably easiest to see with volunteer firefighters, but it is common with other volunteer groups as well. Adopt-a-highway programs <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/reason_package/reason_4.0/www/images/652629.jpg">use signage on roadways</a> to designate the groups responsible for cleaning them, and Philadelphia Block Captains are given ID cards and an appointed liaison from the city to assist in their efforts.</p>
<p>This official sanction from government seems to be missing when it comes to civic hacking groups.</p>
<p>To be sure, it is not uncommon &#8211; particularly in cities like Philadelphia and Chicago &#8211; to see city representatives regularly attending civic hacking events. But the presence of these people represents an ambiguous commitment from government primarily because most civic hacking events take place after hours or on weekends. Are these individuals attending in their official capacity, or as enthusiastic volunteers themselves? It&#8217;s not always clear.</p>
<p>The one investment that governments have always made in the volunteer activities that support their efforts are resources &#8211; typically financial. In fact, it is the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/sunday-review/the-disappearing-volunteer-firefighter.html">lack of resources</a> that has most directly impacted the success of these volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>I think that civic hacking needs to be viewed in this broader tradition of volunteerism in America &#8211; a tradition that is important to the effective and efficient delivery of public services. Governments need to officially recognize and partner with outside hackers and technologists &#8211; not unlike <a href="http://techpresident.com/news/23508/nyc-launches-code-corps-program-focused-emergency-and-disaster-response">what was tried in New York City</a> under the Bloomberg Administration.</p>
<p>In addition, governments must invest in the resources to support civic hacking &#8211; most importantly, governments need to provide high quality open data and other &#8220;raw materials&#8221; for creating new solutions.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t underestimate the importance of the official sanction and support that other kinds of civic volunteerism receive from government. It&#8217;s what defines these efforts and sustains them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for us to see civic hacking as an essential component of the Collaborative State and recognize its place in the proud tradition of volunteerism that has helped to strengthen this country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since the botched launch of Healthcare.gov, procurement reform has become the rallying cry of the civic technology community.</p>
<p>There is now <a href="http://citiscope.org/story/2014/how-barcelona-and-philadelphia-are-turning-procurement-upside-down">considerable effort being expended</a> to reimagine the ways that governments obtain technology services from private sector vendors, with an emphasis being placed on new methods that make it easier for governments to engage with firms that offer new ideas and better solutions at lower prices. I&#8217;ve worked on <a href="http://bigideasphl.com/">some of these new approaches</a> myself.</p>
<p>The biggest danger in all of this is that these efforts will ultimately fail to take hold &#8211; that after a few promising prototypes and experiments governments will revert to the time honored approach of issuing bloated RFPs through protracted, expensive processes that crowd out smaller firms with better ideas and smaller price tags.</p>
<p>I worry that this is eventually what will happen because far too much time, energy and attention is focused on the procurement process while other, more fundamental government processes with a more intimate affect on how government agencies behave are being largely ignored. The procurement process is just <a href="https://civic.io/2014/06/18/built-to-fail/">one piece of the puzzle</a> that needs to be fixed if technology acquisition is to be improved.</p>
<p>Right now, the focus in the world of civic technology is on fixing the procurement process. But what if we’re doing it wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Things Better Left Unsaid</strong></p>
<p>During the eGovernment wave that hit the public sector in the late 90&#8217;s to early 2000&#8217;s, tax and revenue collection agencies were among the first state agencies to see the potential benefits of putting services online. I had the good fortune to work for a <a href="http://revenue.delaware.gov/">state revenue agency</a> around this time. My experience there, when the revenue department was aggressively moving its processes online and placing the internet at the center of its interactions with citizens, permanently impacted how I view technology innovation in government.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for people to appreciate now, but prior to online tax filing state tax agencies would get reams and reams of paper returns from taxpayers that needed to be entered into tax processing systems, often by hand. Standard practice at the time was to bring on seasonal employees to do nothing but data entry &#8211; manually entering information from paper returns into the system used to process returns and issue refunds.</p>
<p>The state I worked for at the time had a visionary director that embraced the internet as a game changer in how people would file and pay taxes. Under his direction, the revenue department rolled out innovative programs to fundamentally change the way that taxpayers filed &#8211; online filing was implemented for personal and business taxpayers, and the department worked with tax preparers to implement a new system that would generate a 3D bar code on paper returns (allowing an entire tax return and accompanying schedules to be instantly captured using a cheap scanning device).</p>
<p>When these new filing options were in place, the time to issue refunds plummeted from weeks to days, and most personal income taxpayers saw their refunds issued from the state in just a couple of days. By this time, I had moved to the Governor&#8217;s office as a technology advisor and was leading an effort to help state departments move more and more services online. I wanted to use the experience of the revenue department to inspire others in state government &#8211; to tout the time and cost savings of moving existing paper processes to the internet, making them faster and cheaper. </p>
<p>When I asked the revenue director for some specifics on cost savings that I could share more broadly, his response could not have been further from what I expected. </p>
<p>He told me rather bluntly that he didn&#8217;t want to share cost saving estimates from implementing web-based services with me (or anyone else for that matter). Touting costs savings meant an eventual conversation with the state budget office, or questions in front of a legislative committee, about reducing allocations to support tax filing. The logic would go something like this &#8211; if the revenue department was reducing costs by using web-based filing and other programs, then the savings could be shifted to other department and policy areas where costs were going up &#8211; entitlement programs, contributions to cover the cost of employee pensions, etc.</p>
<p>All too often, agencies that implement innovative new practices that create efficiencies and reduce costs see the savings they generate shifted to other, less efficient areas where costs are on the rise. This is just one aspect of the standard government budgeting process that works against finding new, innovative ways for doing the business of government.</p>
<p><strong>Time to Get Our Hands Dirty</strong></p>
<p>A fairly common observation after the launch of Healthcare.gov is that governments need to <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/g-a-o-tech-director-says-washington-needs-to-think-smaller/">think smaller</a> when implementing new technology projects. But at the state and local level, there are actually some fairly practical reasons for technology project advocates to &#8220;think big,&#8221; and try and get as big a piece of the budget pie as they can. </p>
<p>There is the potential that funding for the next phase of a &#8220;small&#8221; project might not be there when a prototype is completed and ready for the next step. From a pure self-interest standpoint, there are strong incentives pushing technology project advocates to get as much funding allocated for their project as possible, or run the risk that their request will get crowded out by competing initiatives. Better to get the biggest allocation possible and, ideally, get it encumbered so that there are assurances that the funding is there if things get tight in the next budget cycle. </p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of actors in the budget process at all levels of government (most specifically &#8211; legislators) who equate the size of a budget allocation for a project with its importance. This can provide another strong incentive for project advocate to think big &#8211; in many cities and states, funding for IT projects is going to compete with things like funding for schools, pension funding, tax relief and a host of other things that will resonate more viscerally with elected officials and the constituencies they serve. This can put a lot of pressure on project advocates to push for as much funding as they can. There&#8217;s just too much uncertainty about what will happen in the next budget cycle.</p>
<p>Its for all of these reasons that I think it&#8217;s time for advocates of technology innovation in government to get their hands dirty &#8211; to roll up our sleeves and work directly with elected officials and legislators to educate them on the realities of technology implementation and how traditional pressures in the budget process can work to stifle innovation. There are some <a href="http://benkallos.com/">notable examples</a> of legislators that &#8220;get it&#8221; &#8211; but we&#8217;ve got yeoman&#8217;s work to do to raise the technology IQ of most elected officials.</p>
<p>Procurement reform is one piece of the puzzle, but we&#8217;ll never get all the way there unless we address the built in disincentives for government innovation &#8211; those that are enforced by the standard way we budget public money for technology projects (and everything else). We&#8217;re having conversations in state houses and city halls across the country about the <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/city-pension-shortfall-underfunded/2013/11/11/id/536027/">future costs of underfunding pensions</a>, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re having conversations about the dangers of underfunding technology with the same degree of passion. </p>
<p>Time for us to wade into the morass and come back with a few converts. We&#8217;ve got work to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The great truism that underlies the civic technology movement of the last several years is that governments face difficulty implementing technology, and they generally manage IT assets and projects very poorly.</p>
<p>It can be tempting to view this lack of technology acumen as a symptom of a larger disfunction. Governments are thought to be large, plodding bureaucracies that do lots of things poorly &#8211; technology management and implementation are but one of the many things that governments do not do well.</p>
<p>But the challenges facing governments as it relates to technology are quite specific &#8211; there are a handful of processes, all easily identifiable, that work against the efficient adoption of technology by governments. Understanding why governments struggle to implement new technology requires us to understand what these factors are and why they negatively impact technology adoption so specifically.</p>
<p>The challenges that governments face in adopting new technology are not symptomatic of a larger disfunction &#8211; when it comes to the efficient adoption of technology, governments are built to fail.</p>
<p><strong>The Government Procurement Process</strong></p>
<p>Over the past year, primarily as a result of the botched rollout of the federal <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">Healthcare.gov</a> website, there has been significant attention given to the aspects of the government procurement process that hinder efficient technology adoption.</p>
<p>The process clearly does not work well for governments – and many would argue that it does not work well for technology vendors either. Typical government procurement rules shut out many small firms that may be well positioned to execute on a government IT project but that lack the organizational endurance to make it through the lengthy selection process.</p>
<p>The process is complex, costly and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; slow. To illustrate the magnitude of the issue, consider that in the City of Philadelphia the period between a contract award (when a vendor gets selected to work on a project) and the final execution of that contract (when the work actually begins) can take an average of four months for some projects. Some technology solutions have shorter release cycles than that.</p>
<p>This makes the government procurement process particularly ill suited (in its current form) as a means for governments to acquire technology. The pace at which new technologies mature is much more rapid, and the glacial pace at which the government procurement process moves can lock governments into outdated solutions.</p>
<p>The most under-appreciated characteristic of the procurement process is that it’s current design is largely intentional. Governments imbue the process with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.</p>
<p>For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.</p>
<p>There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.</p>
<p>Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.</p>
<p>These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.</p>
<p>In other words, <a href="https://civic.io/2013/12/27/three-hard-truths-for-government-procurement-reform/">the procurement process works largely as it was built to work</a>, but its design makes it a lousy tool for acquiring technology.</p>
<p><strong>The Public Budgeting Process</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps more fundamental than the procurement process, the process used by governments to deliberate and adopt spending plans <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">is deeply flawed</a> as it relates to encouraging innovation generally and adopting new technologies specifically. There are built-in disincentives in the public budgeting process for agencies to demonstrate large efficiency gains that result in the need to outlay fewer dollars.</p>
<p>Public agencies that have unused allocations at the end of a fiscal year – money that is appropriated but not spent – inevitably see those dollars redirected to another agency or policy priority in the next budget cycle. Mayors, governors, and legislators see this as an effective way to allocate finite resources between competing interests. If an agency doesn’t spend down their entire budget allocation, they must not need it and a reduction is justified. In other words, the budget process works as government administrators have designed it to work &#8211; to reallocate resources away from agencies that don&#8217;t need them to agencies that do.</p>
<p>However, most agencies see this outcome as unfavorable &#8211; a diminution of their mission and a loss for the clientele that they serve and are advocates for. It can be a powerful disincentive for agencies to use new technologies to create efficiencies that result in cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>Employee Recruitment &amp; Retention</strong></p>
<p>Most government employees &#8211; at the federal, state and local levels &#8211; are hired into an agency through a merit-based <a href="http://www.phila.gov/personnel/About.html">civil service system</a>. The development of civil service systems, which are supposed to grant job opportunities on the basis of merit, were a response to widespread political patronage that was common long ago. </p>
<p>Most civil service systems have fairly rigid job classifications and salary structures, meant to provide transparency into what specific positions are paid and to place limits on the ability to reward specific employees because of political preference or for other reasons. There are typically requirements for public job postings, and advertisement of openings for specified period. Applicants are typically required to demonstrate fitness for a position and may often be required to take a civil service exam to demonstrate minimum competency on a particular subject.</p>
<p>Not unlike the procurement system, we imbue certain values into the civil service system in the hopes of fostering outcomes deemed favorable. For example, in the City of Philadelphia the <a href="http://phillycode.org/20-1101/">children of police and fire personnel are given preference</a> in the civil service process. This is not meant to suggest that granting such applicants a preference is inherently a bad thing, but (as with the procurement process) using the civil service system as a vehicle for fostering outcomes can come at the cost of making the process more lengthy and complex for all applicants.</p>
<p>Public sector salaries and benefits generally lag behind the private sector, and altering pay structures and adding new job classifications in response to changes in the world of technology can be difficult. This is particularly troubling for those interested in recruiting top IT talent into government because, unlike with many other kinds of government job types, governments are in direct competition with the private sector for IT workers. A &#8220;system administrator&#8221; or a &#8220;web developer&#8221; or a &#8220;project manager&#8221; requires largely the same kinds of skills and experience inside of government or outside.</p>
<p>Like the procurement process and the budget process, the civil service system works as it was designed to work. Unfortunately, the way that it works makes it ill suited for attracting and retaining a highly skilled IT workforce.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Building to Fail</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s particularly interesting is that even if the policies that underpin each of these processes doesn&#8217;t change at all in the next several years, the problems that governments face in adopting new technology will get steadily worse. That&#8217;s because the pace of change in the world of technology continues to accelerate &#8211; as it does, the difference between the rate at which new technologies mature and the rate at which governments can make budget or purchasing decisions, or reclassify jobs and salaries in response will get larger.</p>
<p>The old Hippocratic maxim of &#8220;first, do no harm&#8221; will be insufficient in addressing this problem. We absolutely must do better, and we must do it soon.</p>
<p><strong>How Do we Fix It?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for advocates of successful technology adoption in government to understand why governments face so many challenges in acquiring and implementing technology. The processes that support paying for and acquiring technology, and the process for hiring IT workers are designed in a way that make them a bad match for the dynamics of the technology industry. </p>
<p>Knowing why governments face challenges in implementing new technology is important if we&#8217;re going to find ways to address the problem. When we examine the range of different approaches being advocated to help governments more successfully adopt technology, we should evaluate their merits based on the degree to which they address one or more of the processes detailed above.</p>
<p>There are lots of other examples of efforts underway to help governments get better at implementing and using technology &#8211; too many to discuss fully here. But the ultimate success of each will be tied &#8211; I believe &#8211; to the degree to which they help address the challenges engineered into one of the three processes discussed above &#8211; procurement, budgeting and employee recruitment / retention.</p>
<p>Governments are not bad at adopting new technologies on accident. The processes that support the adoption of new technology were built to fail. Understanding this is the first step to fixing them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sustaining civic technology will mean that both government&#8217;s IT infrastructure and the civic technology sector that builds on it will need to change.</p>
<p>A pair of recent blog posts caught my eye and highlighted this theme in my head, and motivated me to capture a few thoughts on this topic.</p>
<p>The first post was by Dan O&#8217;Neil, Executive Director of the Smart Chicago Collaborative. <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/2014/02/some-thoughts-toward-the-maturation-of-the-civic-innovation-sector-of-the-technology-industry.html">Dan&#8217;s post</a> on the the things that need to happen to drive the &#8220;&#8230;maturation of the civic innovation sector of the technology industry&#8221; are worth the read. It&#8217;s a great post that helps highlight the connection between legacy IT system in government and open data, which is used to build civic technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;[without] existing legacy gov IT systems, there would be no civic tech. The data we use for our civic tech projects doesn’t get collected, managed, and exported by itself.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The second post is from the Bay Area design firm Stamen, and highlights the need for data visualizations (and other bits of civic technology that rely on open data) to be maintained over time. The post <a href="http://content.stamen.com/a_tale_of_two_cities_maps">uses the analogy of gardening</a> to underscore the need to constantly update and maintain the things we build with data.</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;If you plant a flower in a garden and then never give it water or light, it will in fact die. Unless, of course, it happens to placed in just the perfect spot, in which case it will need to be pruned. Either way, some kind of tending is always required.</p>
<p>We don’t always think of digital works in the same way, perhaps because their metaphor of creation more closely resembles that of a built object, like a bookcase or building. But even buildings need maintenance, and after so many years, the shelves on the bookcase may falter and need new ones. We need to be more conscious about this aspect of dynamic data visualization, at the outset.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>These two posts call out the need for both the government technology systems that lie at the foundation of open data, and the civic technology that uses this data to get better. To mature. To advance to the next level.</p>
<p>For me, the takeaways from these two posts are pretty clear.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and civic apps are like gardening &#8211; except when they&#8217;re not.</strong></p>
<p>I like the analogy of gardening applied to investment in technology solutions. It underscores the need to continually invest in the maintenance and upkeep of the solutions that are used to consume government data. However, I think there is some danger in using this analogy in that it obscures the the fundamental nature of change in the technology world. </p>
<p>I can tend my garden today in pretty much the same way as someone did 100 years ago &#8211; soil, water and sunshine. Boom. However, when building a technology solution (particularly web-based solutions) its not feasible to use the same approach or components that might have been acceptable as recently as 10 years ago. Budgeting for maintenance and enhancements for technology projects isn&#8217;t a nice to have &#8211; its absolutely essential to their success. The pace of change in the world of technology is just too fast for anything less.</p>
<p><strong>We have to fix the budget process as it relates to investment in technology.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="https://civic.io/2012/05/25/bizzaro-budgeting-and-public-sector-innovation/">harped on this before</a>, but we most definitely need to get better at helping non-technology people in government (particularly budget officials) understand the need for continuous support and maintenance of IT projects. Correction &#8211; we need to help them understand technology better in general. Not since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelor_(U.S._TV_series)#Seasons">first season of The Bachelor</a> has there been a worse match than the current public budgeting process and the pace of change in the world of technology.</p>
<p>To understand how acute this problem is, ask some you know that works in state or local government if they (or someone they work with) interacts as part of their job with a technology system that is 10 years old or older. I think the responses would be surprising to many people, and rather alarming to most professional technologists.</p>
<p><strong>Government needs to embrace its role as a data steward</strong></p>
<p>Governments need to understand their role in the civic technology production chain. The current public budgeting and procurement processes make us lousy at investing in the kinds of technology that chance rapidly &#8211; like those that power web-based solutions. </p>
<p>When I read the post by Stamen about their Crimespotting project with the City of Oakland, I see a city that hasn&#8217;t accepted its role as a mature data steward:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;&#8230;over the years, the project started wavering. Oakland’s API has sputtered to the point of being nonfunctional, rendering Oakland Crimespotting totally spotless.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If governments are serious about open data, they need to invest in systems that will make their data easy to consume and readily available &#8211; without this, the civic technology sector won&#8217;t go far. </p>
<p>I think part of this is <a href="https://civic.io/2012/11/18/the-app-economy-and-gov-as-a-platform/">accepting the role of data steward</a>, and engineering our IT infrastructure accordingly. I don&#8217;t know if Stamen&#8217;s was the only project consuming the Oakland crime data API, but building a robust community of users around open data can help public officials see the importance of investing to keep these systems stable and available.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t underestimate the  power of open source</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to helping ensure that civic technology solutions continue to thrive after launch, there is almost nothing better than leveraging the power of open source. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with closed source solutions built on top of open data, but if governments are paying for custom solutions from vendors to display open data we should <a href="https://github.com/cityofphiladelphia/myPhillyRising">insist that the underlying code be open sourced</a>. This can go a long way toward helping ensure that it continues to evolve over time, as civic technologists contribute fixes and enhances and (potentially) as other governments fork these solutions for their own use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really cool to see the conversation around civic technology and open data focused on how we can take the great work that has been done to the next level. I think it means we&#8217;re ready for the next steps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advancing the innovation agenda within government often means confronting the <a href="https://civic.io/2012/01/23/will-lack-of-procurement-reform-smother-civic-startups/">harsh reality of the government procurement process</a>. This is not a new problem, and there are a number of initiatives underway in governments around the country aimed at “streamlining” or “overhauling” the government procurement process to support the acquisition of new technologies and projects that engage smaller and more nimble companies with new solutions.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia, in particular, is engaged in <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/11/11/243799076/a-few-places-where-government-tech-procurement-works">some progressive efforts to use the government procurement process</a> as a means to develop an ecosystem of smaller companies that offer innovative new ideas to longstanding city problems. If the goal of using the procurement process to stimulate (or at least not hinder) innovation inside government is to be realized, reformers in Philadelphia and elsewhere will need to face some hard truths about procurement reform.</p>
<p><strong>Balancing Values</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
[M]any of the factors that make government procurement processes complex and slow are also things that are intended to produce desired outcomes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The arguments in favor of reforming the government procurement process bear a striking similarity to arguments used by advocates for overhauling the federal income tax system. Both sets of advocates point to the problem of unnecessary complexity as an element that can stifle innovation or even harm participants. In many instances, the same verbs are used when calling for reform—words like “overhaul” and “streamline” can be used almost interchangeably when talking about tax reform and procurement reform.</p>
<p>The federal income tax system is a useful reference for talking about procurement reform. It is often used by governments as a vehicle for achieving desired outcomes that (as many economists will quickly point out) have nothing to do with an efficient tax system. We imbue our tax code with certain provisions that, we hope, will help achieve outcomes deemed to have broad societal value.</p>
<p>A perfect example of this is the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest. As a country and a society, we value homeownership over other kinds of investments, so our tax system “rewards” this investment with a special deduction. The objective is to encourage more homeownership because it is highly correlated with desired outcomes, like higher property values and more stable neighborhoods. This deduction comes with a cost, however: it increases the complexity of tax forms, and it increases the effort required both to process these forms and to audit taxpayer compliance.</p>
<p>There are many other examples of income tax provisions that are specifically engineered to produce outcomes with broad social benefits—a myriad of deductions and credits for married couples, particularly those with children; deductions for contributions made to charities; and deductions for interest on student loans. Each of these examples shares two characteristics: they are designed to encourage specific outcomes, and they increase the overall complexity of the system. On an individual level, the cost of these broader societal benefits manifests as more time and effort to comply with income tax requirements.</p>
<p>Procurement processes are similar in many ways. Governments imbue these processes with requirements and other stipulations that they hope will lead to outcomes that are deemed desirable. Each of these requirements adds to the complexity of the process and the burden of firms that choose to respond to government RFPs.</p>
<p>For example, almost every government has purchasing requirements for minority- and women-owned businesses, and many have requirements that local companies receive preference over firms from outside the jurisdiction. The objective is to drive more government procurement dollars to minority- and women-owned businesses and to local businesses that create local jobs and pay local taxes.</p>
<p>There are also larger, overarching values embedded in the procurement process. For example, fairness and transparency are values that inform requirements like the public posting of bids and related materials, ample public notice of vendor meetings, and the clear specification of when and how bids must be submitted.</p>
<p>Risk aversion is another value that impacts the complexity and cost of the public procurement process. It is this value that informs requirements like performance bonds, vendor insurance, scrutiny of company financial statements, and requirements for financial reserves—all things that seek to reduce the risk assumed by governments from engaging with a company to provide a good or service. Each of these requirements can make the procurement process more complex and burdensome for bidders, particularly smaller companies.</p>
<p>All of this underscores the point that many of the factors that make government procurement processes complex and slow are also things that are intended to produce desired outcomes. These features of the procurement process were designed with a specific intent, and few people would argue with the laudable goals they seek to encourage. Yet, one of the side effects of these requirements is that they make the process slower, more complex, and harder for smaller and more nimble firms to participate in.</p>
<p>Efforts to overhaul or streamline the procurement process will undoubtedly run up against the provisions just discussed. Are there ways to streamline the procurement process that don’t require provisions of this type to be relaxed or removed, or are there ways to relax these provisions without compromising the laudable outcomes they seek to encourage? This remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>Nimbler Doesn’t Always Mean Better</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>
Simply making the government procurement process “simpler” won’t guarantee that better IT decisions get made
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the great myths in government IT is that the private sector is always way ahead of the public sector in how technology is used.</p>
<p>In between two tours of duty in state and local government, I spent about ten years in the private sector working for both large and small technology firms. Before joining <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/author/mark-headd/">Code for America</a> as Director of Government Relations in 2011, I worked for four different technology companies headquartered in places as different as Horsham, Pennsylvania; Blacksburg, Virginia; and San Francisco, California. I learned a lot about technology and how to be a software developer during this time, but I also learned that—as far as technology is concerned—the grass is not always greener on the other side.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of poor technology decisions in the private sector. We just hear about them less often because they are usually not a matter of public record or visible to the public through a budget submission or legislative hearing.</p>
<p>To be sure, governments around the world have issues with implementing technology, but some of the things I’ve seen in the private sector have been shocking—inexcusably bad decisions made by people who should know better, a complete lack of strategic thinking about how technology is used to benefit the company, and dragging old legacy technology along far past its point of usefulness simply because upgrading would be tricky and complex—the list goes on. The private sector has all of these problems and more. We just don’t hear about them as much.</p>
<p>What my experience in the private sector made exceedingly clear to me is that it is entirely possible (and not very unusual) for private sector organizations, unshackled by complicated procurement processes like those used by governments, to make lousy choices and invest poorly in technology.</p>
<p>Simply making the government procurement process “simpler” won’t guarantee that better IT decisions get made. Governments will still need to think more strategically about how they invest in technology and become better at learning how it can be used to make the delivery of public services more efficient and effective.</p>
<p><strong>A Dearth of Makers Inside Government</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>If the people who work for government don’t have a clear enough sense of how things get made, they are ill-equipped to evaluate RFP responses from individuals or companies that want to do work on behalf of the government.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My experience working as a software developer for several years, and continuing to work with other developers from a variety of disciplines for years after that, has affected the way I approach problems. Whenever I hear about an application or service or an idea someone has for one, I’m often privately thinking (as I think most people who have worked as developers are), how would I build something like that? This is probably true of most people who have built things for a living.</p>
<p>Understanding how things work and how to build them can be a useful skill when evaluating the level of effort required to perform a service or to solve a problem. This is something software developers do often—estimate the amount of time it will take them (or their team) to complete a series of tasks they have not yet begun. It’s hard to do well. Even software developers who do this often will sometimes underestimate or overestimate the amount of time required to complete a task.</p>
<p>The ability to translate a problem into a series of steps that a person can imagine herself doing is the specific byproduct of making things. This is a problem in government, where, in general, there is a woeful lack of awareness about how things are made and what resources and materials are required to build things. In short, there is a critical lack of makers in government.</p>
<p>This problem is particularly acute when it comes to technology and how governments acquire it, even for needs that should be simple and relatively cheap, like content management systems for websites and web-based applications. The web is now an essential component of how governments deliver services and communicate with citizens, and yet, there are far too few people inside government (including those in the technology discipline) who have a solid understanding of how the internet works.</p>
<p>In just the last few years, the world of software development has seen a sea change that has transformed how web and mobile applications are built. Never before has it been easier or cheaper to build these applications. Yet governments continue to overpay for them (or the services of those firms that build them) because there is very little in-house knowledge of how these things are built.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that effective websites and useful web applications are easy to build and don’t require skill. They certainly do, but without a fundamental understanding of what the technologies behind these applications are, how they work, and how they are changing, governments cannot distinguish the skilled vendors offering reasonably priced solutions from the shysters.</p>
<p>If the people who work for government don’t have a clear enough sense of how things get made, they are ill-equipped to evaluate RFP responses from individuals or companies that want to do work on behalf of the government. This is especially important for technology procurement, where new software development paradigms can evolve rapidly.</p>
<p>Governments need to place an emphasis on recruiting and hiring people who have experience making things. In addition, governments need to focus on developing the “maker skills” of existing employees. This, by extension, will enhance the ability of governments to evaluate the estimates for work provided by respondents to RFPs.</p>
