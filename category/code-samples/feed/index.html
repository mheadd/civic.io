										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important qualities of open data is that it can provide unparalleled insight into how a city works.</p>
<p>Open data empowers urban storytelling &#8211; the process of identifying a trend, or some important characteristic of an urban area and then presenting that information in a compelling way for others.</p>
<p>When I speak about open data, one of the things I emphasize is that the tools for creating stories with data are becoming more powerful and widespread everyday. With the right data, it&#8217;s not hard to tell an important or compelling story about a city. To prove my point, I decided to &#8220;put my money where my mouth is&#8221; at a recent civic hacking meetup in the Northern Liberties section of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Police Department recently released a hugely important dataset &#8211; <a href="http://opendataphilly.org/opendata/resource/215/philadelphia-police-part-one-crime-incidents/">major crime incidents</a> occurring in the city. This data is available as both a static download (updated with the latest information each morning) or through set of APIs. I decided to use this data set, and a tool that&#8217;s been on my list to experiment with for a while &#8211; <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/post/32464928928/torque-big-data-meets-time-based-maps-bundled-with">Torque</a>, from CartoDB &#8211; to tell an urban story.</p>
<p>The code I wrote to tell my story is on <a href="https://github.com/mheadd/philly-homicides">GitHub</a>, and you can see the data visualization I built <a href="http://mheadd.github.com/philly-homicides/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a screencast of the steps I took to build this visualization &#8211; as I have said many times, the amount of effort required to build a compelling civic application (provided the right data is available) is trivial. See if you agree after watching this short video.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LpWN0kYZhro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>The technology is elegant. The visualization is cool. But the story itself is rather sad &#8211; there are way too many homicides in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Our Mayor and other city leaders are working hard to change this. Just recently, Mayor Nutter <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/cityhall/After-mass-shooting-in-Newtown-Nutter-calls-for-sensible-gun-laws.html">articulated the frustrations of mayors from across the country</a> who are calling for tighter restrictions on the guns that cause so many of the homicides in Philadelphia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I think part of the change that Mayor Nutter and other mayors are calling for is showing people the magnitude of the problem. This is what a compelling visualization can do &#8211; it can reach someone the way that a written story or even a one-on-one conversation often can not.</p>
<p>The problem of violence that plagues urban areas isn&#8217;t just a challenge for our city leaders. It&#8217;s a challenge for all of us &#8211; we all need to be a part of making positive change happen. One way to reach people and motiviate them to be a part of the change is to build a compelling visualization &#8211; to tell a compelling urban story. With the right tools, almost anyone can do it.</p>
<p>This is the power of open data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a great weekend for civic hacking.</p>
<p>Daylight Savings Time has given us an extra hour, advances in telephony application development have made it dead simple to build text messaging applications and Google has given us the <a href="https://developers.google.com/civic-information/">Civic Information API</a>.</p>
<p>With an election on Tuesday, I wanted to build a quick application that demonstrated the ease with which SMS apps can be built and the power of Google&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>The address of a polling place is both valuable and succinct &#8211; it&#8217;s the ideal kind of information to deliver through multiple communication channels. Text messaging (SMS) is a fairly ubiquitous communication channel, and in some cities &#8211; like Philadelphia &#8211; it&#8217;s an important way to engage with citizens that may face barriers to digital access.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIQSKihBJcg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p>The screencast above demonstrates how to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/4008408">the script I developed</a> using the Google Civic Information API and the <a href="https://www.tropo.com/">Tropo</a> telephony platform.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this, and there are a <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=SMS">large number of text messaging platforms and services</a> to choose from, so if you want to use your extra hour this weekend to help people find their polling location pick the one you like best and get cracking.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never been easier to build useful communication and messaging apps &#8211; in fact it&#8217;s getting easier every day. And with the richness of information available through APIs like Google&#8217;s Civic Information API, it&#8217;s never been easier to build an app that will help people get to their polling location.</p>
<p>Election day is just around the corner. Use your extra hour this weekend wisely&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most powerful things about open government data is all of the options it enables.</p>
<p>Open data is the single most important ingredient in civic apps, and it can also power visualizations, mashups and countless other civic uses. The very best open data typically lends itself to several different kinds of uses.</p>
<p>When paired with the <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/">increasingly sophisticated tools and APIs available to developers</a>, building powerful and useful civic applications with open government data has never been easier.</p>
<p>This post is meant to provide a quick overview to using open government data to build a civic application &#8211; to demonstrate that someone with moderate coding ability, even if they&#8217;ve never built a civic application before &#8211; can go from &#8220;zero to civic&#8221; in just minutes.</p>
<p>The screencast below demonstrates how to take an open data set for health inspections from the City of Louisville, KY and build a simple but easy to use text messaging application using open source and free tools.</p>
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnV5hln6vSA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></div>
<p><span id="more-2582"></span></p>
<p>Imagine going out to eat with friends or family &#8211; you happen upon a new restaurant and you&#8217;re interested in finding out more. You can check Google or Yelp for reviews, but what if you wanted to know how a restaurant fared on a government health inspection? For that, unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t a lot of options.</p>
<p>In Louisville, KY, you can now check how a restaurant or food service establishment fared on their latest inspection using the simple SMS application demoed here.</p>
<p>When governments like <a href="http://data.louisvilleky.gov/">Louisville</a> release open data, they enable options for how people consume information. Having more options about how to get data that you find important is awesome.</p>
<p>Think about the weather &#8211; there are scores of different ways that you can consume information about what the weather will be like on a given day. Because the <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2010/08/18/how-weather-data-became-open-data/">data behind weather forecasts is open</a>, it is integrated into all sorts of different channels and platforms. This makes it easier to consume, because consumers can now choose the way in which they get the information they want.</p>
<p>The technology utilized in this demo is pretty straightforward and mainstream. PHP and MySQL are ubiquitous and widely supported.</p>
<p>Should a developer choose a different kind of database to store the Louisville health inspection data, that&#8217;s an equally valid choice. If they&#8217;d rather use a different technology for their application &#8211; that&#8217;s also fine.</p>
<p>Developers are free to use the technologies they find most appealing, and to design the interface they believe is most useful.</p>
<p>Open data is the key to all of these options.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the foundation on which an increasingly <a href="http://www.citygoround.org/">vibrant ecosystem of applications</a> is built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roughly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/09/04/gov-20-its-all-about-the-platform/">three years ago</a>, Tim O&#8217;Reilly defined a vision for &#8220;Government as a platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, there are <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/apitag/?q=government">around 240 API&#8217;s listed on Programmable Web that identify as &#8220;government&#8221; APIs</a>. This number is sure to climb in the weeks and months ahead, as more and more governments, public authorities and agencies deploy APIs for developers to use.</p>
<p>One such API, recently released as part of the relaunch of <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/">Regulations.gov</a>, got my attention when it was <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/regulations-gov-relaunches-with-apis-integrates-social-media-hopes-for-public-participation/">highlighted by Alex Howard of O&#8217;Reilly Media</a>.</p>
<p>The Regulations.gov API is part of a broader effort to use new technology and social media to engage citizens in the public rule making process.  </p>
<p>The rise of API-based programming, and the dramatic success of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> in recent years over other kinds of API formats (i.e., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>), has helped spur lots of innovation and even changed the way that people build software. It&#8217;s encouraging to see efforts like the Regulations.gov relaunch try and tap into this energy and grab some developer mindshare to spur innovation.</p>
<p>But if governments are going to attract developers with APIs, then it makes sense to look at government APIs and evaluate them against other, more commonly used APIs to see how they stack up.  People respond to incentives, and developers are no different &#8211; if an API is well documented and easy to use, developers are more likely to give it a try.  The more &#8220;friction&#8221; an API has, the less likely it is to attract developers.</p>
<p>How does the new Regulations.gov API measure up? I decided to take a few hours to give it a test and find out.  Here&#8217;s what I found.</p>
<p><span id="more-239"></span></p>
<p><strong>Sign me up!</strong></p>
<p>The Regulations.gov API requires an API key to use &#8211; this is pretty common in the world of API programming, but Regulations.gov introduces some unneeded friction here. </p>
<p>Most widely used APIs built around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> offerings are largely self-service. They are set up to get developers up and running quickly with little or no need for &#8220;hands on&#8221; assistance from support staff.  The process of signing up for a API key is usually frictionless &#8211; provide some basic information and a valid e-mail address and your off to the races.</p>
<p>I had to request a Regulations.gov API key using a plain old web form &#8211; submitting my name, phone number and e-mail address.  This request was manually processed, and I received an e-mail back from support staff the next day asking me to identify the organization I represented.  </p>
<p>I explained in my response that I was doing independent research and noted my intention to write about the experience of using the Regulations.gov API.  Shortly thereafter, I received my API key and was able to start testing.</p>
<p>The reason for this process being manual is not obvious to me. I completely get the need to issue an API key, but surely this process can be automated.  At present, the API is read only (via GET requests) so there isn&#8217;t all that much users can do currently other than run queries.</p>
<p>The entire process took about 1.5 &#8211; 2 days to complete &#8211; far too long in my opinion if I had intentions of using the Regulations.gov API at a hackathon or other civic hacking event.  The event might have been finished by the time I got my API key to beging testing.</p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any reason why this process couldn&#8217;t take minutes rather than days. This seems like needless friction that will discourage many developers from giving this API a hard look.</p>
<p><strong>The weak link in the chain</strong></p>
<p>They say that a chain is only as strong as it&#8217;s weakest link. I say that an API is only as good as it&#8217;s documentation. </p>
<p>This is another area where I think the Regulation.gov API could be improved. The API docs are in <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/docs/Regulations_Gov_API_User_Guide.pdf">PDF format</a>, and are somewhat tedious to navigate. There are lots and lots of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">very good examples</a> to emulate when designing API documentation.</p>
<p>Additionally, I found the names of some of the parameters used with API calls a bit cryptic &#8211; e.g., &#8220;Comment Period Start Date&#8221; is represented in an API call as &#8221; cmsd&#8221;, while &#8220;Comment Period End Date&#8221; is represented as &#8220;cmd&#8221;.  I realize this is a bit picky, but it would be much nicer if these parameters were more clearly named.</p>
<p><strong>Less talk, more code</strong></p>
<p>Overall, I found the Regulations.gov API easy to work with.  In the course of a couple of hours, I reviewed the documentation, rans some quick command line tests to kick the tires a bit and then pounded out a rudimentary script.</p>
<p>Here is a simple Node.js script for querying the API and displaying the results. Complete code for this simple demo <a href="https://gist.github.com/1893123">can be found here</a>.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
// Include required modules and config.
var http = require('http');
var util = require('util');
var config = require('./config');

// Search options.
var dct = process.argv[2] || 'O';
var a = process.argv[3] || 'EPA';
var cp = process.argv[4] || 'O';

// Options for HTTP  request.
var options = {
  host: 'regulations.gov',
  port: 80,
  method: 'GET'
};

// Build path to API endpoint.
var path = '/api/documentsearch/v1.json?dct=' + dct 
  + '&amp;a=' + a 
  + '&amp;cp=' + cp 
  + '&amp;api_key=' + config.credentials.api_key;

options.path = path;

// Create HTTP client and make request.
var apiCall = http.request(options, function(response){

  // Simple string to hold response from API.
  var searchResult = '';
  response.on('data', function(chunck){
    searchResult += chunck;
  });
  response.on('end', function(){
    var doc = JSON.parse(searchResult);
    
    // Print out number of documens found.
    var docs = doc.searchresult.documents.document;
    
    // Write out Docket ID for each.
    util.puts('Search found: ' + doc.searchresult.recordCount + ' documents.');
    for(var i=0; i&lt;docs.length; i++) {
      util.puts(docs[i].docketId);
    }
  });

});
apiCall.end();
</pre>
<p>One observation on the results returned from the document search endpoint &#8211; which this sample script uses &#8211; the document structure returned is somewhat complex and not especially well documented.  I wasn&#8217;t easily discernable from the documentation what the structure of the result would be based on specific parameters included in the search (I opted for JSON as the result format).</p>
<p>As a result, when the default search options are changed (by passing in different arguments to the script when it&#8217;s executed) the resulting <a href="https://gist.github.com/1893123#gistcomment-85697">Docket ID listing is incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>I might be missing something obvious, and it seems likely that this might be clearer to someone with a bit more familiarity with the structure of proposed regulations. But if the goal here is to attract mainstream developers to use the Regulations.gov API, then I think there is an opportunity to improve the documentation in this regard.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like what I see in the Regulations.gov API. If you haven&#8217;t had a play with it, I would encourage you to request an API and give the documentation a look.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s heartening to see the vision for &#8220;Government as a platform&#8221; becoming reality. Looking forward to more great APIs from government agencies.</p>
