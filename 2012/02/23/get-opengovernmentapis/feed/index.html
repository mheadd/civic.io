					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I am the developer behind Regulations.gov API implementation. First of all, many thanks for the review; this kind of feedback helps us move in the right direction! I agree with you on most of those concerns. 

We realize that the registration process is manual and a bit cumbersome and plan to improve that in the near future. I apologize for the delay in processing your request and would like to emphasize that the registration shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours for most requests. 

The documentation is a work in progress and we plan to incorporate more online information and a developers section on our website in the near future. 

Once again, on behalf of the whole program, I am appreciative of this feedback. Please bear with us while we make improvements and continue using the API and providing feedback!]]></description>
