					<description><![CDATA[Kristy - I absolutely would.  

I think leveraging new communication channels to give people more options in how they get information from and communicate with government can only benefit communities.

An entire community is better off when members are better informed and better able to reach out to their government leaders and elected officials.  At least to my way of thinking.

Training government officials to more effectively use social media sounds like a great idea to enhance civic engagement and participation.

Congrats on the new endeavor!  Don&#039;t hesitate to let me know if I can ever help in any way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, insightful post. I&#039;m wondering if you would consider a government social media consulting startup to be a civic startup? I just launched http://DigitalGovGroup.com because I have a passion for governments using social technologies to their fullest potential, and I think there&#039;s value for citizens in teaching govts how to engage the right way. So our services will hopefully contribute to voters being more engaged...but we&#039;re not offering a software application, or any solution derived from public APIs. Do you think startups like mine would be part of the civic startup club? That would be a badge I&#039;d be proud to wear.]]></description>
