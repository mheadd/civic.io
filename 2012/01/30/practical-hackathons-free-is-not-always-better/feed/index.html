					<description><![CDATA[Kav - great points.

Thanks for mentioning the prize angle as well.  I&#039;ve also been a part of some events with relatively meager prize money, but huge dedication by participants and great outcomes.

Price to participate is indeed a weird thing. My current thinking it needs to be low enough so as not to turn anyone off, but large enough for them to want to get their money&#039;d worth by showing up at the event.

If I can get them in the door to the event, I know I can get them excited about building and creating something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having run into this a few times myself I think you are absolutely right. I&#039;ve also found that the level of focus and dedication to results at the hackathon itself correlates to the price as well, and far more than other motivators. I&#039;ve facilitated hackathons with thousands of dollars in prizes but free entry that had less dedication and drive from participants in Startup Weekend events with $100 tickets and not much in the way of prizes.

Predictably Irrational has some great insights on this. Free is a weird thing. By not engaging our &quot;is this worth it&quot; value exchange models we tend to jump on free things, even those we don&#039;t want at all. Even further with free it&#039;s all upside. If I go to a free event and do nothing all day I perceive this as a great deal, even though it cost me a day. 

On the other hand once our economic value exchange is engaged; i.e. once we start asking is this worth the $10, we think about getting our moneys worth at the event as well. We say &quot;I paid $10 I need to get that value back&quot; and thus we need to fully engage or lose our money.
