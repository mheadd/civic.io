					<description><![CDATA[Given the ratio of inquiries to service requests, it is perplexing to me to see the in-balance in media coverage and (perhaps) effort towards Open Fix My ____&#039; apps that runs on the latest gadget.

One nugget that I read that guides my line of thinking and action is...&quot;if they have to call...&quot; to get answers, &quot;..then there is something wrong&quot; (meaning...something better can be done to avoid this call in the first place).

Further, service delivery tiers make it challenging to the citizen to know &quot;who does what&quot; .

I would like to see a private sector solution that aggregates government knowledge-bases and packages localized answers to citizens in a way that they will consume...because &quot;it is just there&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, you&#039;ve been pushing for an Open311 Inquiry API for quite a while now, and I&#039;ll have to agree with you that it represents a vast opportunity for accelerating adoption of Open311.  As you noted in citing the Pew Philadelphia 311 Report, the 311 Community overall typically experiences a 75% to 25% ratio of Inquiry and Referral calls to actual Services Requests.  

Recognizing this, 311 cities are indeed looking to channel the majority of these calls into self-service modes (IVR, web FAQs), leaving live-agent responses for real requests for service.  Of course, this requires a robust yet easily searchable knowledgebase along with standardized key words.

I  believe an Open311 Inquiry API would be crucial in helping cities drive this self-service along with the necessary standardization.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kate,

Yeah that&#039;d exactly what I mean. You set up a range of options for people to get the service they need and (hopefully) set the right incentives on those options so people are able to select the one that works best for them.

What&#039;s interesting is how technology can be used to set up these incentives. If we make it quick and frictionless to get information via a website or mobile app, people that can self serve that way will more likely do do.

This will reserve more expensive resources (in terms of time and money) for those that can&#039;t self serve.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, this triage strategy that you outline for 311 sounds a lot like what Richard Zorza has been advocating for the courts and civil legal aid for at least the past 10 years ( and probably longer). At its foundation is the idea that everyone should receive the service they need but in the cheapest way possible. In this, there is the acknowledgement that not every tool available will be right for every person, but rather than start with the assumption that everyone needs to be represented by an attorney for every legal problem, you save representation for the problems and people who need it. Otherwise money is wasted on cases where people could have represented themselves but didn&#039;t and leaves people and cases that require representation without the help they need because resources don&#039;t exist. I wonder how many other areas of government and human services could benefit from looking at the same type of model.]]></description>
