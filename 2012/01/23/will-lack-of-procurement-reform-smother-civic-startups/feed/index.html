					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for shedding light on the procurement problem and explaining where governments are coming from. It&#039;s arguably the biggest obstacle facing the open gov movement: we won&#039;t transform the public sector without overhauling procurement to fit modern software development. But we won&#039;t find a tractable solution that doesn&#039;t address governments&#039; legitimate concerns about risk mitigation and preventing the waste of taxpayer dollars.

The (tragic) irony, though, is that the current rules virtually guarantee wasted resources and deserve much of the blame for the IT gap between the public and private sectors. The high barriers to entry posed by byzantine procurement requirements protect large incumbents and shut out innovative startups.

Take the case of the lobbyist RFP you highlighted above. The city wanted an app that would 1. move lobbyist registration paperwork online, and 2. display the resulting lobbying data on a transparency website. It just so happens Open City had just built that transparency site -  www.chicagolobbyists.org - for Chicago&#039;s app competition, so we decide to bid for the rest. 

Despite the fact that chicagolobbyists won a judge’s choice award, the contract went to Crowe Horwath, the same accounting and consulting firm that built the City of Chicago’s current website in 2010. The previous administration paid them $1.8 million dollars to build the site; they subcontracted out the site&#039;s development to a firm in Ohio, despite the abundance of local tech talent interested in civic development. To put it bluntly, the site could be better, so the new administration is looking to redesign it (rightly, in our view) just two years later. That same company is now likely to get paid thousands to reinvent the wheel.
