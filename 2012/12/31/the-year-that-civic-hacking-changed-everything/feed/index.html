					<description><![CDATA[I should have been a little clearer when I referred to &quot;experts&quot; - I meant people outside government who have never been to a hackathon. There are a surprising number that feel qualified to talk about innovation in government. It incites my nerd rage. ;-)

I do agree tat we need domain expertise at hackathons - I posted recently about a RHoK event we had in Philadelphia that had tremendous participation from public sector folks.

These are domain experts I&#039;d like to see more of at civic hacking events.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tweeted that I disagree with an assertion or two but that I am strongly aligned with this post. Civic hacking is the way coders, makers, designers and web natives participate in society and government. We can keep observing and lamenting that no one (but the elderly) goes to public meetings anymore, not even the reporters. We can also observe that civic hacking is the participation. I think we should participate more &quot;in real life&quot; - in person - but i also recognize and support the value of civic hacking for more reasons that any counter-argument could ever...portend. Civic hacking need not even be constrained to the app discussion. As you&#039;ve heard from me before, what we did with Hampton Roads Transit wasn&#039;t about an app. It was about transforming the way HRT delivers data &#038; information. The app is a stooge. Any movement like this is multi-faceted and will have its share of proponents and detractors. I appreciate that you speak out against the naysaying. I disagree with this point as I read it, but I wonder if you entirely meant what I read: &quot;Civic hacking events do not need better ‚Äúguidance‚Äù from experts or input from the class of professional consultants cum contrarians ‚Äì they need more open data from governments. Period.&quot; We do need guidance from experts. I&#039;ll look the other way on the blanket stereotyping of professional consultants and allow that many IT environments have been utterly spoiled by the professional consulting model. To reduce the requirement to &quot;more open data from governments. Period.&quot; is a bit like declaring randomness necessary and sufficient. Even if we allow that some blind hacking on detailed, domain-specific data by programmers who are at best amateur subject matter experts has value - which I do - we still benefit and *need* domain experts. We civic hackers learn when we talk to them. Our insight, approaches and solutions are informed when we communicate with domain experts. Understanding a process to which information technology will be applied requires understanding the process. That requires communicating with the actors. When coding for scientific visualization one cannot become an expert in the science being visualized without becoming that scientist. The reverse is also true. Neither are too practical. I&#039;ve worked with scientists who coded their own stuff. That&#039;s the gray side of hacking, i.e., was ugly...and ultimately why I was hired at ODU out of grad school. Non-programmers programming is part of what created the status quo. Programmers and experts need to collaborate. Think of it as classic separation of concerns.]]></description>
