					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mark:

My name is Barbara McAleese, I&#039;m the Assistant Director of Marketing at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing.

I&#039;m writing to invite you to join our round-table lunch discussion on October 5 with City Councilman Bill Green to explore collaboration between Penn Nursing&#039;s new Healthcare Innovation Lab and the City&#039;s new Open Data Initiative. 

Our faculty are working on a variety of healthcare open data projects with CMS and HHS. Penn Nursing Professor Kathy Bowles has partnered with a recent Wharton grad to launch a successful startup called RightCare Solutions - it&#039;s an application that helps to reduce hospital readmissions amongst high-risk patients. The startup has attracted close to a half-million dollars in prize funding.

Other roundtable attendees include Wharton, Penn Engineering, Penn&#039;s Center for Technology Transfer, and Penn&#039;s Government Affairs office.

We would love it if you could join us!
