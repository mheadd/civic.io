					<description><![CDATA[Luigi - totally agree.

Governments should plan for success when they sponsor app contests, and figure out ahead of time what they want to get out of these contests.

One of the other things that has come out of many of these contests (including the Sunlight contests) is app code.  Nice when developers can build off what others have already done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;d like to see is more followthrough from governments *after* the apps contests have ended.

At Sunlight, the biggest success we point to from the contest model came out of our second Apps for America contest, where an entry (GovPulse.us) became an actual federal website in FederalRegister.gov. In that case, some forward-thinking folks at the Office of the Federal Register contacted the development team behind GovPulse and contracted them to do a .gov version. FederalRegister.gov is now an open source app available on GitHub.

Governments all around the world are promoting innovation through these contests and the release of open data. But they need to embrace that innovation by contracting out the best projects for further, serious development.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s sad to hear how the changes in DC ave impacted what was once the leading municipal government in the open gov movement.

You should take a considerable amount of pride, though, in watching what you helped get started spread to other cities and states.

And you make a fair point, I too wish the pace of adoption were faster.  But I&#039;m also excited about what I see happening in Philly, Baltimore and Chicago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Mark. I&#039;ve got a few thoughts in response:

1. I was in fact commenting on the &quot;stampede&quot; nature of what I&#039;m seeing in the EU - a strong, pan-european movement towards open government through open data. Compared to what&#039;s happening in the US at this time in history, it doesn&#039;t have the same energy. There&#039;s a lot of energy for sure - but comparatively the EU seems to be gaining steam and the US is...slow and steady? Not a bad thing I guess.

2. I think you&#039;re right about the open government movement in DC. There basically isn&#039;t one from a municipal perspective. It has nothing to do with the Mayor - it has everything to do with the fact that we&#039;ve had 4 CTOs in 3 years at OCTO and its budget has been cut nearly 30% from when we were working on Apps for Democracy to today - with additional cuts planned.

3. DC has dropped the ball, and others are picking it up. I think that&#039;s great. I especially can&#039;t wait to see what Chicago does with that dream team up there.]]></description>
