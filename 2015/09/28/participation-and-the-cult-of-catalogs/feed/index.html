					<description><![CDATA[We should consider the possibility of another exception to the 6th principle of open data, and it has to do with the cost of infrastructure and usage rates.

Internet companies that have public APIs (e.g. Google Maps) already use throttling to limit the amount of requests per minute that clients can do. Scaling infrastructure up to meet usage demands is something that costs money, and when we&#039;re talking open government data this is taxpayers&#039; money. So if e.g. just one corporate consumer of open government data is consuming all of the capacity, either the government scales up the service capacity (thus raising costs) or not (degrading the usage experience for everyone else). I don&#039;t think either option is fair to citizens. So, to use a rate limited throttling for the general case, and to provide a special access token for the big consumers that lifts or raises those limits (possibly at a cost to them, to cover the additional operational costs) does seem a fair thing to do.

Of course, the anonymous (if rate limited) access to open data must always be provided, in order to foster experimentation and lower the barriers to usage of open data. To be fair, the 6th principle never mentioned that you shoudn&#039;t use throttling anyway.

As for the original reason you mentioned for having non-anonymous access to open data, please see Leigh Dodds&#039; discussion of the same issue: http://blog.ldodds.com/2015/11/25/how-can-open-data-publishers-monitor-usage/]]></description>
