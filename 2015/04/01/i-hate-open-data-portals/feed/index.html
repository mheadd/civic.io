					<description><![CDATA[Found this post very interesting.

However, as someone who works in local government as a developer, and exports data on a regular basis to a city data portal, I&#039;ve found no reason to use the data portal internally.  For two primary reasons:

1. The data portal provides an external means for citizens to access data where the master copy is held within internal systems.  If we&#039;re developing apps we&#039;ll be able to go direct to the source - something that is generally much harder to make available to local developers.  It&#039;s not that &#039;we won&#039;t eat it ourselves&#039;, the data portal is perfectly good and useful, it just wouldn&#039;t make architectural sense for any internal app to go to data that has been exported where it could go direct.

2. A benefit of Open Data is that citizens are able to create apps with that data.  The biggest challenge with open data has been finding datasets that are able to be released under a complete open data licence.  Once those data sets are found and released I&#039;d far rather leave them to the community to create apps with, focussing on creating useful solutions with the datasets that can&#039;t be made open.  That seems in general a better use of local government time and gives better &#039;coverage&#039; of the data.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark
Forgive me if I&#039;ve got this wrong but I&#039;m pretty sure the UK Gov&#039;s Department for International Development is eating its own dogfood through DevTracker: http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/ It&#039;s populated from its IATI data feed. Here&#039;s their data architect describing their approach: https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/2013/06/05/eating-our-own-dog-food/

					<description><![CDATA[Mark,

I&#039;ve been waiting to reply until we had some more written up about the Housing Data Hub (http://housing.datasf.org), so jumping in a little late to the game. But basically, we&#039;ve been working for the past couple of months on building this and very actively working toward using our open data APIs in it.

There&#039;s much more about the process of building here: http://datasf.org/blog/raising-digital-barn Mostly, this gives the overview of our approach, but I&#039;ll have deeper reflections/technical points on how we used the portal APIs and what we learned in doing so later on (likely as part of the code documentation).

The high point is we&#039;re making API calls to power a set of visuals across a number of datasets, providing context to those interested in policies that affect housing affordability in San Francisco. This is part of our broader approach of doing strategic (or thematic) releases.

Note, the Hub is not about accessing affordable housing, just understanding the policy context with supporting administrative datasets. But, while I&#039;m on that distinction, let me air my broader concern around dogfooding and open data portals. I think we are still at very early stages of maturity in the open data world around processes, methods and technologies. This is why I wouldn&#039;t build a product to access affordable housing using the open data portal as a backend. The current portal products are by their nature broad and apply to many different data and needs, but sometimes the requirements of the product may not be met by an open data portal. For example, handling private data, complex relational data, or maintaining SLAs at much higher levels than open data portals can currently provide. The APIs being inaccessible for a visual on eviction notices won&#039;t stop business in the City, but it very well could if critical services are built off of them. (Tom gets at this earlier in his response regarding making pragmatic choices).

I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re suggesting using open data portals for all government services, but I just wanted to take a moment to reiterate here that I think broadly we need to use the appropriate technology for the job, and consciously design open data access into those approaches so that surfacing the public data is straightforward. This will be a critical mark of a maturing open data program.

All that said, I totally agree with the notion of dogfooding and what it can bring to government, but it is one piece of a broader strategy to institutionalize open data approaches at the City. The housing data hub is an example where we&#039;re dogfooding, and you&#039;ll see more in a couple of months. It is decidedly wonky, but for an outward and inward facing audience. Dogfooding has allowed us to understand the challenges and opportunities with API access in a hands on way. The things we are learning will then be shared back to the world through our website and github repos, and internally through our City training program, the Data Academy (http://datasf.org/academy). 

Thank you for the engaging post! My hope is that we can all grow and learn together and I&#039;m encouraged by the broader community and trajectory of all the great work that cities, states and the Federal government continue to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[G&#039;day,
  Nice rant! :) A couple of comments:

You complain that open data portals have useless bells and whistles (sorting, grouping, graphing, visualising) yet lack features (realtime support, revision history etc). Basically you just want more. Ok.

IMHO (having worked with quite a few government bodies on open data stuff now), the most important thing government can be doing is releasing data. There are other groups (civic hackers etc) who can build nice features, but no one else can release that data. So it&#039;s ok if &quot;open data portals suck&quot; if resources are being spent instead on actual data release. If.

Realtime data. Well, it&#039;s hard, it&#039;s new, and it&#039;s niche. There&#039;s really not much genuinely &quot;realtime&quot; data. Frequently by the time it makes it to the open data portal, it&#039;s minutes or hours old. Is better access to this &quot;realtime&quot; data really a concern for *now*?

And finally revision history? Sounds exactly like the kind of value added service that the open data community can add, and I don&#039;t see much wrong with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Mark,

I&#039;ve thought the same on some of the points you have made, but have also been thinking about various solutions.

No One Eats Their Own Dog food: With CKAN 2.3 the resource views should allow for extensions to be developed that allow visualizations to be embedded within other Govt sites. With such a platform I&#039;m hoping we&#039;ll a few things emerge:

1. Govt directly embedding the viz from a portal&#039;s dataset view into their own agency site to help communicate with various audiences.

2. Govt directly embedding the data capture tools into their own agency sites to help collaborate with citizens. (general forms, requests for consultation, survey&#039;s etc)

3. Data First Web Design - I think this will be a thing before too long :) 

4. Govt understanding that their data portal is useful infrastructure that can be used as the backbone for all kinds of solutions. 

Get Out of the Way and Give Me My Data!: I agree and believe the primary users of a data portal are machines, the secondary users are custodians and the tertiary users are anyone else (which includes the casual hacker or two browsing for data they&#039;ll connect to machines ;) ).

Lack of Support for Realtime Data: I&#039;m hoping this will be pushed forward pretty quickly with more cities connecting up sensors to capture data. I think there will be some exciting applications for those working with realtime data and I think portal software such as CKAN is &#039;ready&#039; for the challenge. I can see there is a good install base and an increasingly active developer community behind the project.

Personally I&#039;m looking for realtime data projects to push the boundaries of CKAN and hope to have some news on that soon.  

No Revision History: I&#039;ve looked into this for CKAN with regard to custodian use cases (rolling back after an update to a resource, etc). My company was waiting until the 2.3 release (now out) before running at some of this stuff too hard. But, I think you&#039;re right with regard to diffs and requests for optimization. Will be thinking on this more :)

Hoots!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s a lot of people inside gov and outside (advocacy, media, community groups, citizens) that could use a wishlist board to post their needs. Not only for the datasets themselves but, for the output. The individual visualization, map, table or output that would help them do a better job - ultimately helping make life better. It seems if you&#039;re seeing this apathy then the solution is to get the line-workers inside government, and active citizens, the ability to nudge leaders in a forward direction. 

Perhaps such wishlist items could be rated and commented on by individual subscribers? Such feedback wouldn&#039;t push development because of the relative ease in an interested party to load up &#039;interest&#039; eg. an aggressive anti-any-change group engaging it&#039;s social media audience to stymie real insight into problematic conditions.   

It seems too what&#039;s needed is the opportunity for the &#039;wish&#039; creator to be able to do so within an anonymized system where they can ask for solutions and contribute responses to questions anonymously.  The reason being that insiders can outline creative ways to expose or otherwise display data that would help others to see elements for the first time or from a different perspective. Without anonymity, many insiders may be too politically or career intimidated to make such suggestions publicly.  

Ideally such a tool would spawn more civic-stakeholder engagement and ideally some actual change by government internally. Since posts are public, entrepreneurs, existing civic-tech enterprises, civic hacks (from Code For America Brigades to independent hacks inside and outside government) could review and select projects to complete. 

Such a portal would be valuable if subscribers could view solutions others have utilized and request  deployment in their community or some modification. 

Finally, more value would be created if all stakeholders had an ability to present deployments, challenges, opportunities, testimonials etc. that could help future communities engage without paying the heavy price of death by apathy or poor execution.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Mark!  &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.beta.nyc/t/feb-20-codeacross-kick-off-town-hall-with-dr-mashariki-nycs-chief-analytics-officer/276/7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I share the same frustrations with open data&lt;/a&gt; and I couldn&#039;t agree more.

And you&#039;re right, the dirty secret of data portals is that they&#039;re primarily used as fancy FTP servers.  API usage is pitifully low because the data is not readily usable.

At Ontodia, we aim to address some of these issues by &quot;productizing&quot; out of the box functionality beyond an FTP server - making it easier to &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pediacities.com/2015/02/open-data-is-geospatial-data/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;create customizable, embeddable, production-ready maps (not just map viewers)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Ontodia/openrefine-ckan-storage-extension&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to publish clean data&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pediacities.com/2015/02/talk-is-not-cheap/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;to fostering discussions around datasets&lt;/a&gt;, etc.

We even bundle a dog-fooding geocoder that geocodes uploaded datasets using previously uploaded spatial datasets (i.e. if you upload a neighborhood association GeoJSON, you can geocode against that).

As a CKAN specialist, I&#039;m a tad biased but remain hopeful.  A lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ckan/ideas-and-roadmap/issues/142&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ckan/ideas-and-roadmap/issues/141&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/2368&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; are being addressed by the community as &lt;a href=&quot;http://extensions.ckan.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;we collectively scratch our itches&lt;/a&gt;.

I think we&#039;re still in the early days of Open Data.  Remember AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy and all the proprietary networks before the Internet?  What about all the proprietary CMSes before Wordpress, Drupal, et. al.? 

So how can we move to the next stage?  Some thoughts:

* &lt;b&gt;open standards&lt;/b&gt; - real-world standards that emulate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GTFS example&lt;/a&gt; that address a real-world need

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great post Mark!  <a href="https://talk.beta.nyc/t/feb-20-codeacross-kick-off-town-hall-with-dr-mashariki-nycs-chief-analytics-officer/276/7" rel="nofollow">I share the same frustrations with open data</a> and I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re right, the dirty secret of data portals is that they&#8217;re primarily used as fancy FTP servers.  API usage is pitifully low because the data is not readily usable.</p>
<p>At Ontodia, we aim to address some of these issues by &#8220;productizing&#8221; out of the box functionality beyond an FTP server &#8211; making it easier to <a href="http://blog.pediacities.com/2015/02/open-data-is-geospatial-data/" rel="nofollow">create customizable, embeddable, production-ready maps (not just map viewers)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ontodia/openrefine-ckan-storage-extension" rel="nofollow">to publish clean data</a>, <a href="http://blog.pediacities.com/2015/02/talk-is-not-cheap/" rel="nofollow">to fostering discussions around datasets</a>, etc.</p>
<p>We even bundle a dog-fooding geocoder that geocodes uploaded datasets using previously uploaded spatial datasets (i.e. if you upload a neighborhood association GeoJSON, you can geocode against that).</p>
<p>As a CKAN specialist, I&#8217;m a tad biased but remain hopeful.  A lot of <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ideas-and-roadmap/issues/142" rel="nofollow">these</a> <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ideas-and-roadmap/issues/141" rel="nofollow">very</a> <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/issues/2368" rel="nofollow">issues</a> are being addressed by the community as <a href="http://extensions.ckan.org/" rel="nofollow">we collectively scratch our itches</a>.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re still in the early days of Open Data.  Remember AOL, Compuserve, Prodigy and all the proprietary networks before the Internet?  What about all the proprietary CMSes before WordPress, Drupal, et. al.? </p>
<p>So how can we move to the next stage?  Some thoughts:</p>
<p>* <b>open standards</b> &#8211; real-world standards that emulate the <a href="http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-2/pioneering-open-data-standards-the-gtfs-story/" rel="nofollow">GTFS example</a> that address a real-world need<br />
* <b>reference implementation of those standards</b> &#8211; create apps that consume the standard that can be quickly implemented in another jurisdiction<br />
* <b>APIs everywhere</b> &#8211; with CDOs, CAOs CDSs, CTOs now becoming more common in government at every level, service oriented architecture should become more common in time as we work towards Government as a Platform.  This will take a while<br />
* <b><a href="https://usopendata.org/2015/03/25/rdc/" rel="nofollow">Regional Portals</a></b> &#8211; let jurisdictions pool resources, talent and users<br />
* <b>Aggregators</b> &#8211; a lot of this data was wrangled, aggregated, and repackaged in the private sector, even before data portals.  Regional portals, undoubtedly, will perform some of this, but the private sector, specifically in the CivicTech sector, will still play a role</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen, Brother.  

I believe that Open Data vendors are inflating the need and value of their service.  Many gov&#039;t agencies already provide data for free.  Why should we spend a lot of $$$ to dumping into a portal when it&#039;s already available.  Open Data vendors have created a false market for themselves.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric - thanks for your comments, really appreciate you sharing this information.

I&#039;d echo to you what I said to Tom in an earlier response - most of my concern about dogfooding relates to governments leveraging the APIs in their portals to build officially branded, externally facing apps. Essentially, doing from inside government what civic hackers are doing from outside

KCStat and the Open Budget site are nice, but those are both products that are provided by Socrata that are tightly coupled to their open data portal software. They are (effectively) extensions of the Socrata platform, and don&#039;t really represent the city independently consuming the APIs it is making available to outside developers - at least not to my way of thinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can definitely say that city staff use the data portal for Kansas City (Data.kcmo.org). For example, the Office of Performance Management gets most of their data for analysis directly from the portal. We built it this way to make sure that the data is useful, accurate, and recent. We want staff to rely on it, because it ensures that it will be kept up to date. 

The KCSTAT program and internal performance management meetings rely heavily on this data for analysis. When we present our visualizations, we let people know that the data is available to them too. This data may reveals problems that we then address via process changes. Most of the data that he Mayor, City Council, and City Manager see come directly from the data portal. Socrata has published some information about these types of efforts at http://www.socrata.com/newsroom-article/socrata-launches-open-data-tv-odtv/. 

They City has also built out a series of dashboards to monitor progress on the City Council&#039;s Goals and Priorities. You can visit these at kcstat.kcmo.org. Additionally, budget.kcmo.gov has only recently been launched, but is already being used by Departments and Budget Analysts to get a quick view of what their budget looks like. This process used to require advanced knowledge of our financial system. Therefore, the ability for any staff member to check out their budget with a few clicks saves a lot of staff time. 

I agree with Tom that tracking staff use of Open Data is really challenging. The platform Open Data provides is extremely useful - and is something staff seems to rely on once they learn how to use it efficiently. For example, the ability to upload a spreadsheet and map it without having to use GIS software is a fantastic resource for analysts across the organization. It also frees up our GIS experts for more complicated projects. The visualizations that you can generate may not be stellar, but they are effective at communicating information. The Open Data portal has made it much easier for staff to use and communicate data effectively and efficiently.]]></description>
