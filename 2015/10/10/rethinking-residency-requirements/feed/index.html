					<description><![CDATA[Ben - great thoughts, and you&#039;re right: I am mostly telling one side of the story here.

I do think, though, that developing local self-sufficiency (particularly in technology) is a very different proposition for small &#038; midsized cities than it is for places like NYC, Chicago or SF.

Even cities like Philly have challenges - some great technologists &#038; designers with an interest in public service that live in the suburbs. How can the city leverage their talents more effectively?

An issue worth more discussion I think.

Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a great topic for discussion!

I do think you&#039;re not describing the benefits that residency requirements have on pushing government to be equitable and forward-thinking. Rather than focusing on the struggle of individuals to come into compliance, I&#039;d like to know &quot;why couldn&#039;t the government hire that role from within its current residents?&quot;. I think every outside hire should be viewed as a failure to develop local self-sufficiency.

You see this failure of local self-sufficiency playing out, for example, in urban housing crises in which teachers cannot afford to live within the urban boundaries. This is not a failing of the teachers, but rather a failing of the government to not provide (either/both) equitable salaries or develop affordable housing. 

For tech workers, I fear that relaxing residency requirements looks like carpet-baggery: reinforcing tech as privileged outsiders and agents of an extractive economy. Would it be a bridge to develop a local base up which residency requirements could be reinstated, or is a beach-head to relaxing the requirement for other (privileged) positions?]]></description>
