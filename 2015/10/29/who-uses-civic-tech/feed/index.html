					<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark - We met at Urban.us conference last year &#038; this is reply to &quot;Who Uses Civic Tech&quot;. 

We&#039;ve had quite a journey and it took a side project (Cards Against Urbanity) to show us (1) how to engage and (2) civic tech to what end?  Reporting a pothole outside your house has an obvious connection, but why one should care about affordable housing, transit routing, the budget process, a new comprehensive plan.... 

We pivoted to tech + games. This Governing article is a good summary. http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-cards-against-urbanity.html   Bottom line - (1) Reliance on the public meeting + powerpoint kills communications and (2) basic knowledge on what programs are and how they work essential  

Just launched the new product referenced in the Governing article - City Design Method Cards. It&#039;s basically Cards FOR Urbanity - we are testing a theory that civic tech needs its own &quot;platform for great cities&quot; to inspire people before they can fully (and happily) engage on the big stuff.  
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/910898498/city-design-method-cards

Hope this helps. We are still watching how the allocation of resources is playing out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David - I was involved in a project like that before. There is a good write up of our efforts &lt;a href=&quot;http://technical.ly/philly/2011/08/24/philly-snap-hackathon/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Worth noting that though we were able to get support for some outreach and to raise awareness, we ran up against a wall when we asked the city to help spread the word of its availability.

This makes me think that it might be worth exploring whether the problem is how we&#039;re building civic apps, or how we&#039;re marketing them.  I wonder if anyone has considered that and looked into it more deeply.

Eric - I share your concern as well. I&#039;m now living in a place that - population wise - is much similar to where you are. I too worry about whether or not we are listening closely enough to the challenges facing these areas as well as the big cities.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[David Shaeffer&#039;s comment echoes one of my thoughts. Much of civic tech is driven by technologists who over-focus on the product itself and neglect all the other parts of the process. Even when civic tech is volunteer-driven and free, we need to think about marketing and ongoing communication with users (as well as how we maintain the product going forward). Another question that arose for me re-reading the study just now is the extent to which sites (esp in the US) are optimized or not for use on mobile. Aside from a few comments, that data wasn&#039;t provided in the discussion, but may be relevant to under-representation of younger people and non-whites in the US.

Finally, one of the things that worries me generally in civic tech is the danger of leaving behind all of the smaller places, not only rural towns and counties, but also smaller suburbs in urban areas. In my area, for example, &quot;Asheville&quot; has an area population of over 300K, but only 80K are in the city itself - the majority live in other jurisdictions, all of them with much smaller populations. And of course folks living in the surrounding, mostly rural counties are even worse off. Civic tech is these places hard to measure because we can&#039;t get big enough samples of users from them, and they&#039;re underrepresented in civic tech generally because they lack the resources, local developer communities, etc. I see figuring out ways to bring them along and to understand the particular issues they face as one of the important challenges we need to be looking at.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed this when I first read it in October and now again -- thanks, Mark. When I think of civic tech and who uses it, I keep coming back to issues of education, marketing, and organizing. 

Specifically with the WH&#039;s recent Opportunity program, I wonder what efforts will be made to get these new solutions in front of the people that need them most (marginalized and underserved).  Do you know if there are plans in place to evangelize these solutions? Are there any good examples of a civic tech solution built for the marginalized and underserved that dedicated resources to education and evangelization?  

To me that step in the process -- getting the solution to the people that need it most -- is lacking, but I&#039;d love to be proven wrong.]]></description>
