					<description><![CDATA[You raised a few questions; let&#039;s start with being coöpted through close alliance with City partners. 

OpenOakland made a rule that we would avoid new projects until a City partner signed on. This grew from the experience of our founding brigade captains; they were embedded in cities during their CfA fellowships. The benefits have been strong, sometimes: improved access to data, to City experts, and support at product launch; credibility with the public and other partners. 

But it&#039;s also meant that we&#039;ve turned some volunteers away because their projects didn&#039;t lend themselves to a City partnership. A few potential City partners couldn&#039;t find enough of a following among our members for a team to form. And one time we abandoned a project because our City partner had drawn us into a situation where our success would create more harm than good.  

You asked if civic tech volunteers are at risk for being &quot;gentrified&quot;? 

I&#039;ll interpret that in a few ways (correct me if I&#039;m off topic for what you intended). 

There&#039;s gentrified as in a group displaced by people with more money/resources/status. I can&#039;t speak for other brigades but OpenOakland started being mostly male, mostly white, and mostly well-paid tech professionals. After conscious effort, the group is larger, has more balanced mix by gender, race, sexual orientation, age, and, with an almost even balance of tech pros with subject matter volunteers. 

There&#039;s also gentrified as in softened, less-street, less confrontational. Ahem. Oakland is one of those places where agit-prop is a subculture, an art form, a hobby, and so frequent that Oakland&#039;s police note about 150 public marches, rallies, protests, and other passionate demonstrations each year. And yet quiet diplomacy, respectful advocacy, educating staffers and elected often work better than packing a hearing with protesters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I somewhat agree with Steven. I suspect that many civic hackers start out with great, creative ideas, but over time (and particularly with government engagement) gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they want to tackle. Having that context may cause them to self-censor or limit their own creativity in favor of directing their energy at problems which seem more solvable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Steve - appreciate the insights.

I&#039;m convinced that there is an appropriate balance between collaboration and confrontation, though not always sure of the best way to strike it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good article Mark.

I generally view civic hackers as similar to public artists. Both have outputs which provide a social good. Both are driven by the passion of individuals or groups acting in concert.

There is an establishment surrounding many forms of art and I think we are seeing the formation of such establishment around groups involved in civic hacking. It isn&#039;t a bad thing that state, corporate and philanthropic sponsorship supports the creation of social goods - but it does add to the weight of that potentially oppressive &#039;establishment&#039;.

I&#039;ve certainly been guilty of smoothing out behavior that might make some of our Government supporters here in Australia uncomfortable. Usually this is about educating folks that there is always a wider perspective to consider but I can see how it could become something which works against the creative disruption of old ideas and methods.

However, in response to your article I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll see the gentrification of civic hacking. Rather, we&#039;ll likely start identifying some as mainstream, some as alternative, some as anti-establishment, etc.]]></description>
