					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It seems without a corporate sponsor/corporate support these standards are hard to propagate.&quot;

That&#039;s a really interesting point. The food safety inspection data standard that was recently announced had a corporate partner - Yelp.

I&#039;m interested to see if cities can pull this off without direct corporate involvement. I plan to reach out directly to other cities - Baltimore, Chicago, Boston, etc. - and engage them on the flu shot location standard I&#039;m developing.

Stay tuned!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark, I enjoyed your post and agree that data standardization is really the future of open data and where it has real potential to increase the business value of open data. 

My idea for open data standardization is financial reporting. Imagine if we could easily compare financial reports between municipalities, for example. This would help inform municipal executive decisions such as: how much should my IT or HR budget be? It would also provide transparency   to citizens who could also assess how well their municipality is managed compared to other municipalities, considering the services that they receive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mark,

Great post, this is something that I&#039;ve been working on somewhat on &#038; off for the past few years except with the goal of defining an open data standard for recreation information.  It&#039;s tough for myself and the others who are working on this because we don&#039;t have a compelling commercial interest to show a city as Google did with GTFS.  It seems without a corporate sponsor/corporate support these standards are hard to propagate.]]></description>
